ID	Abstract
1	19 year old female with Crohn disease developed jaundice with high ALT levels, rash, fever, eosinophilia and lymphadenopathy after 8 weeks of sulfasalazine therapy, resolving within 4 weeks.
2	20 year old woman with Crohn disease developed fever 3 weeks after starting sulfasalazine accompanied by a mixed pattern of serum enzyme elevations without jaundice and had recurrence with a similar anicteric pattern 4 days after restarting.
3	9 year old girl developed arthralgias, fever, splenomegaly and ANA-positivity with normal serum enzymes and no jaundice 9 months after starting hydralazine; symptoms resolved within 1 and serology within 11 months of stopping.
4	Among 40 patients with psoriasis treated with 8-methoxypsoralen and ultraviolet light, 6 had transient elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, but further specifics were not given.
5	31 year old woman on OCCs for 11 years was found to have a large hepatic mass and secondary lesions shown histologically to be hepatocellular carcinoma; no details of follow up given.
6	17 year old male with long standing aplastic anemia treated with oxymetholone developed sudden rupture of right lobe of liver and autopsy revealed multiple hepatic nodules and adenomas.
7	13 year old girl with rheumatoid arthritis developed jaundice 5 months after starting penicillamine with recovery in 3 months; no specifics given; benorylate is an ester of acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen.
8	48 year old man with renal insufficiency developed rash, fever and abdominal pain 4-5 weeks after starting allopurinol [bilirubin 1.1 rising to 7.7 mg/dL, ALT 134 U/L, Alk P 1317 U/L, 10% eosinophilia], liver biopsy showing cholangitis and cholestasis, died of multiorgan failure.
9	2 men, ages 72 and 58 years, developed fever, rash and eosinophilia 2 and 4 weeks after starting allopurinol [bilirubin 2.4 and 0.5 mg/dL, AST 510 and 65 U/L, Alk P 198 and 200 U/L], one required prednisone for rash, both recovered.
10	Two brothers with Fanconi’s anemia on long term androgen therapy both developed malignancies, including leukemia, gingival squamous cell cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
11	Literature on the mechanism of action of sex steroid hormones is rev iewed. The effects of estrogen, progesterone, and androgen on RNA metabolism, RNA polymerase activity, the accumulation of specific protei ns, the transcription of specific messenger RNA's and their translation, and genetic transcription in vivo and in vitro are discussed.
12	Analysis of first 100 patients in a registry of liver tumors in women found 40 adenomas, 44 focal nodular hyperplasias, 13 liver cancers and 4 unclassified tumors, mean age 30 years [14-47 years], only 4 were never on OCCs, pregnant or on estrogens [4-156 months]; presenting as hemoperitoneum [26%], pain [32%], mass [19%] or incidental finding [20%].
13	Blood chloroquine concentrations were measured in 5 patients having complications related to this treatment. No significant differences were noted when compared to controls. Further studies are required however before drawing any definite conclusions. The persistence of fairly high residual levels, several months after stopping treatment, is evidence of chloroquine retention in these patients. 
14	Seventeen cases of juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis have been seen and treated with microlaryngoscopy, removal of papillomas, and administering of autogenous vaccine. Holinger's original findings could be confirmed. The operation frequency of 9 patients was significantly reduced, 5 were improved, and 3 unchanged. In no case was an undesirable reaction to the vaccine observed. Electron microscopy showed no virus-like particles in the papilloma but a section of a vulvar wart did show the virus. 
15	The authors studied seven patients with sarcoidosis and tuberculosis: the affections co-existed in 3 cases but were separated by varying intervals of time in the 4 other patients. They discuss the diagnostic, therapeutic, and nosological problems posed by these cases, and review the various hypotheses that have been suggested to explain these associations in relation to the pathogenesis of the sarcoidosis. 
16	44 year old woman with rheumatoid arthritis developed large lymph nodes, hepatomegaly and pulmonary infiltrates after 135 mg of gold injections with eosinophila, but minimal to no elevation in AST, Alk P or bilirubin, slowly resolved and liver biopsy was unrevealing.
17	41 year old woman with rheumatoid arthritis developed jaundice 3 weeks after starting penicillamine [bilirubin 3.3 mg/dL, AST 117 U/L, Alk P 1132 U/L], jaundice resolving within 2 weeks and enzyme elevations within 11 weeks of stopping.
18	50 year old man took an overdose [30 mg] of colchicine and rapidly developed fever, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and hypotension with renal failure, acidosis, septicemia, and liver test abnormalities [bilirubin 0.7 rising to 6.6 mg/dL, AST 58 to 333 U/L, Alk P 91 to 667 U/L], but ultimate full recovery; sepsis and hypotension may have contributed to the liver abnormalities.
19	A new procedure for purification of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase resulting in an electrophoretically homogenous preparation made up of 5.10(8) cells (390 mg of protein) is proposed. The enzyme yield is more than 20%. The molecular weights of a subunit and a native enzyme are 55000 and 220000, respectively. The isoelectric point for the protein lies at 4,8. The kinetics of the enzyme thermal inactivation obey the first order equation with the inactivation rate constant of 6.10(-3) min-1. 
20	The in vivo antitumor activities, as measured by inhibition of transplanted P-388 and L-1210 leukemia in mice, have been determined for a series of analogs of anguidine including triacetoxyscirpenol, the three diacetoxyscirpenols, the three monoacetoxyscirpenols, and scirpenetriol. An acetoxy function at position 15 appears to be required for good activity. 
21	A twenty-seven year old man with a two year history of sarcoidosis and systemic manifestations of this disease along with verrucous ulcerative skin lesions is presented. Biopsy specimens of the cutaneous lesions showed typical noncaseating granulomas as well as necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. After other possible etiologies were excluded, prednisone therapy was instituted with prompt resolution of the skin lesions, leaving atrophic scars. 
22	A case of onycholysis secondary to the ingestion of tetracycline hydrochloride is reported. The patient was not photosensitive, and the nails returned to normal after withdrawal of the causative drug. 
23	Elevated histamine concentrations of pathophysiological significance could be determined in plasma of dogs suffering from acute pancreatitis according to Pfeffer. This result was also obtained in dogs treated with aminoguanidine, a very effective diamine oxidase blocker, in addition to the duodenal blind loop preparation. Elevated histamine concentrations were found in nine out of ten dogs. 
24	Review of histology of 9 cases of erythromycin liver injury from Armed Forces Institute of Pathology files; mostly cholestatic or mixed enzyme pattern, all self-limited, [bilirubin 2.1-12 mg/dL, ALT 128-560 U/L, Alk P 2-12 times ULN]; liver histology showed cholestasis and hepatocellular injury.
25	Cell-mediated cytotoxicity of adherent and non-adherent subpopulations of mouse lymph node cells sensitized in vitro on monolayers of syngeneic, methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma cells was examined by inhibition of 3H-thymidine incorporation. The cell-mediated cytotoxicity of nylon wood-adherent, non-adherent and unfractionated lymph node cells was found to be equally efficient. 
26	The clinical results with cardioplegic solutions and hypothermia during aortic cross-clamping are compared with the clinical results obtained with hypothermia only. To complete the study miocardial biopsies were obtained during aortic cross-clamping in order to evaluate the concentration of ATP and CPK. The obtained data confirm the effectiveness of the myocardial protection. 
27	Two patients are reported with hypersensitivity myocarditis. One, a 71-year-old female, was being treated with methyldopa at the time of her death and the second, a 67-year-old female, was receiving tetracycline for a respiratory tract infection. 
28	During serial subcultures 50 micrograms per ml gentamicin and penicillin (100 U per ml)-streptomycin (100 micrograms per ml) depressed cell growth signficantly 2 weeks after the addition of the antibiotics; gentamicin, but not penicillin-streptomycin, stimulated cell growth before it became inhibitory. Removal of the antibiotics resulted in the cell yield returning to normal. The results show that these antibiotics can be harmful to cells even at concentrations thought to be safe. 
29	Naegleria and Acanthamoeba are ubiquitous, free-living amoebas. Infections with Naegleria are acquired nasally by exposure to water and are characterized by an acute fulminant hemorrhagic necrotizing meningoencephalitis leading to death. Acanthamoeba-infections occur in chronically ill, debilitated individuals. A patchy chronic or subacute granulomatous encephalitis is produced by hematogenous spread of the amoebas. The histological or clinical diagnosis is not difficult. 
30	[Glu(OMe)4]oxytocin (XVI) and [Mpr1, Glu(OMe)4]oxytocin (XVII) bearing a methyl ester group in place of the carboxamide group in position 4 of oxytocin were synthesized by (3 + 6) segment condensation using the S-trityl group for the protection of the cysteine side chains. Analogue XVI exhibited 10.5 U/mg in vitro uterotonic, and 42 U/mg avian vasodepressor, activity, and analogue XVII 21.4 U/mg and 82 U/mg of the respective activities. Both compounds showed no response in the rat pressor assay. 
31	31 year old man developed malignant hyperthermia [106.7 oF] 6 hours after ingesting phencyclidine with coma, seizures and subsequent renal failure requiring a 25 day hospitalization; no mention of ALT levels or liver injury.
32	We reviewed 26 patients with brain stem tumors. None had a pre-treatment tissue diagnosis. Four of the 20 treated patients are alive from 22 months to 12 years later, representing no improvement from a preceding series in the same centre. 
33	It is believed that partial destruction of the hepatic lymph drainage during the operation of hepato-portoenterostomy is probably the cause of postoperative attacks of cholangitis. Experimental evidence is described that appears to show that omentopexy to the porta hepatis will aid hepatic lymph drainage and may thus prevent postoperative cholangitis. 
34	Bacteria induce urinary crystallization of struvite and carbonate-apatite as a by-product of ureolysis by urease. Eradication of infection and/or inhibition of urease with acetohydroxamic acid for 5 to 30 months retarded stone growth and brought about partial or comple dissolution of stones in 9 patients. Long-term chemotherapy with antimicrobial agents that achieve steril urine or acetohydroxamic acid in those patients with recalcitrant infection lessens the risk of recurrent calculogenesis. 
35	"Bicycle ergometry on the ""Elema"" electrical bicycle ergometer was conducted on 6, patients of climacteric age (41 to 55 years) with pain in the region of the heart and ECG changes. The method made it possible to confirm the diagnosis of climacteric cardiopathy in 39 and to reveal climacteric cardiopathy and concurrent ischemic heart disease in 23 patients. It was noted that physical load had a favourable effect on processes of repolarization in the myocardium of patients with climacteric cardiopathy. "
36	On the dogs with a Thiry-Pavlov fistula (an isolated loop of the small intestine) the effect of 30-min acceleration on the absorption of thiamine-bromide, riboflavine, pyridoxine-hydrochloride and ascorbic acid as well as on the gastric juice secretion was studied. It was demonstrated that back-to-forth linear acceleration increased vitamin B1 absorption, decreased vitamins B2 and B6 and ascorbic acid absorption, and altered secretion of gastric juice. 
37	Four women, ages 20, 30, 35 and 68 years, who had repeated episodes of liver injury after sulfonamides with shortening of latency upon reexposure, but no worsening of injury [usually hepatocellula] or slowing of resolution, which ranged from 4-12 weeks.
38	"Histologic description of livers from 30 vineyard sprayers' exposed chronically to high levels of copper, found copper granules in Kupffer cells in all 30, with granulomas, fibrosis [portal], nodular regeneration [""liver function was usually normal""] angiosarcoma, cirrhosis and NCPH, although the rates of these findings were not given."
39	A fluorimetric method for analysis of tranylcypromine from plasma is described. After extraction from plasma tranylcypromine reacts with 1-dimethylamino-naphthaline-5-sulfonic acid chloride (DANS-Cl) in order to form the highly fluorescent DANS-tranylcypromine. After chromatographic separation on silicagel plates quantitation is achieved by in situ fluorescence determination. The recovery of tranylcypromine from plasma is 64% with a coefficient of variance of about +/- 6%. 
40	Domperidone (R 33812) was injected i.v. for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in a total of 395 cytostatic treatment courses in 172 patients. The total dose ranged from 1 to 40 mg and was given in one or several doses. Even after the administration of severely emetic substances, vomiting and nausea were largely prevented in hospitalized patients, but the results were rather poor in ambulatory patients. In all of the cytostatic treatment schedules very favourable results were obtained. 
41	The experiment carried out on 6 volunteers shows a better bioavailability of a 75 mg single oral dose of Persantin (Boehringer) than of the same dose of Curantyl (Germed). The difference is due to the manner in which the dragĂ©es are manufactured: the bioavailability of both preparations was the same when the dragĂ©es were pulverized before oral administration. 
42	Elevated doses of the cytostatic cyclophosphamide (Endoxan) given daily for 6 weeks, resulted in a prolonged course of experimental trichophytosis in guinea-pigs. From this phenomenon, it may be concluded that the short self-healing course of this disease is due to a rapid triggering of immunoreactions. The fractionated treatment with cyclophosphamide at defined intervals (50 mg/kg initially and 30 mg/kg at 4-day intervals) did not result in any effect. 
43	Newly developed carbonic acids with hypoglycaemic properties are presented. Their activity is based on an insulin secretion with unusual biphasic dynamics which is seen both after enteral and parenteral administration. In vitro, the substances described have an inhibitory effect on gluconeogenesis in the liver and lipolysis in adipose tissue. 
44	After vaginal application econazol is absorbed to a high degree. Plasma levels are maintained for a relatively long period. Metabolism occurs in the vagina already. As there are no objections concerning toxicology the fact of absorption is considered positive from the therapeutical view-point because this drug does exert its effect not only in the vaginal cavity but also in the epithelium. It is suggested that vaginal absorption is influenced by cervical mucus. 
45	In particular, the action of N alpha-methyl-histamine has to be considered since its secretory response is approximately 1.5 times greater than that of histamine and its secretion lasted for a longer period of time. After C-5-alkylsubstitution, both 5-methyl-histamine and N alpha,5-dimethyl-histamine showed secretory action comparable to that of histamine; the agonistic activity, however, decreased with increasing chain length. 
46	The interaction between human and bovine serum albumins (HSA and BSA) were studied with two derivatives of benzamide, metoclopramide (PrimpĂ©ran) and sultopride (BarnĂ©til). It was possible to evaluate association constants (K ass.) characterising this interaction by fluorescence probe technique inspite of the very low binding tendency, which can be correlated to pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs. 
47	It has been suggested in the past that milk causes an impaired absorption of tetracycline and this paper describes a study set up to examine any inhibition of absorption of a tetracycline derivative, lymecycline (Tetralysal) with the concurrent intake of milk. The results of the study show no clinical reason for restricting a moderate intake of milk in conjunction with lymecycline therapy. 
48	During the period October 1976 to January 1978, 290 patients were examined for sexually transmitted diseases in three venereal clinics in Khartoum Providence. Clinical and laboratory findings showed that nongonococcal urethritis was the commonest STD in men (35.1%), with gonorrhoea the second commonest (25.9%). Most of the patients with STDs were aged between 20 and 30 years. Of the infected men, 49.3% had acquired their infections from prostitutes. 
49	When guinea pigs were sensitized to tuberculin by exposure to complete Freund's adjuvant the size of the intradermal PPD test was positively correlated to the body weight of the animal. Old Tuberculin showed stimulating effect in a subsequent sensitization to merthiolate (thimerosal). The high frequency of delayed cutaneous allergy to merthiolate in Swedish population is probably explained by sensitization through intradermal testing with tuberculin containing merthiolate as a preservative. 
50	"A 7-year-old boy with previously diagnosed multifocal eosinophilic granuloma displayed signs and symptoms of a cervical radiculopathy. After myelograpic demonstration of extradural compression, corticosteroid and radiation therapy produced rapid and complete resolution of his symptoms. We suggest that more discrete classification of the ""xanthomatoses"" of the neurologic literature may provide the basis for choosing nonsurgical intervention in selected cases. "
51	Peripheral venous blood samples were drawn before and after induction of adjuvant arthritis in rabbits at intervals of 15 days. Using these samples, biochemical parameters were measured, including total protein, albumin, globulin, cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase. The various biochemical tests exhibited an abnormal pattern in adjuvant animals as compared to the normal rabbits. The significance of these findings has been discussed. 
52	The effect of haemorrhagic shock on the simultaneous appearance of enteric micro-organisms in the central lymph and the portal blood was studied in 30 dogs. Irreversible haemorrhagic shock results in portal bacteraemia but the lymph remains sterile. Thoracic duct drainage is harmful and hastens the onset of irreversibility. 
53	Fifteen patients with early syphilis were seen between May 1974 and March 1975. These 15 patients comprised all the cases of early syphilis that were seen in Edinburgh during this period. Three of them were men of whom two were homosexual. Liver function tests in these three gave abnormal results. 
54	Superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities have been determined in newborns. Their mean values are approximately the same as in normal adults. In some cases a low content of superoxide dismutase and/or a high (superoxide dismutase/glutathione peroxidase) ratio are associated with hematological symptoms. In addition, a low superoxide dismutase activity is associated with hyperbilirubinemia and is present in two of the three cases showing maximal acetylphenylhdrazine-induced hemoloysis. 
55	A 28-yr-old woman was admitted to hospital after a suicide attempt in which she had taken 5600 mg verapamil. On admission she exhibited bradycardia and pronounced hypotension; ECG revealed AV dissociation which persisted for 7 1/2 h after admission. She was discharged well 36 h later. 
56	3H-Spiroperidol of high specific radioactivity labels dopamine receptors in membranes of bovine caudate nucleus and anterior pituitary. The saturation and kinetic properties of 3H-spiroperidol binding are similar in the two tissues. In both caudate and pituitary 3H-spiroperidol displays very high affinity with a dissociation constant of 0.2-0.3 nM. The relative potencies of numerous dopamine agonists and antagonists in competing for 3H-spiroperidol binding are closely similar in anterior pituitary and caudate. 
57	Aldosterone injected i.m. decreased the release of renomedullary PGEs and the index (urinary Na/K ratio) in conscious normotensive intact and adrenalectomized rats. Coadministration of spironolactone increased the release of PGEs as well as the index (urinary Na/K ratio). The effect of spironolactone was partly inhibited by aspirin injected in a ratio 5:1 (aspirin:spironolactone), and effect which could be reversed by the infusion of a synthetic prostaglandin (PGA2) in a subhypotensive dose. 
58	"A study to assess the evolution of the disease in non-lepromatous group, who have taken no treatment in a six year period 1970-1975, was undertaken. Among the 714 patients who did not take treatment, only 432 cases (60.5%) could be examined. The majority of these patients (425) had single lesions. The study revealed that nearly 74% of these ""N"" patients became self-healed. "
59	Experimental investigations have shown that antiaggregants affect the size rather than the rate of venous thrombosis, while clinical trials with prophylactic acetylsalicylic acid have indicated primarily a reduced incidence of pulmonary embolism. Current experiences with acetylsalicylic acid in combination with dipyridamole or low-dose heparin suggest that the incidence of pathology diagnosed by 125I-fibrinogen and of deep vein thrombosis is equally reduced. 
60	The ability of 8-ethoxycarbonyl-10, 11 dihydro-A-prostaglandin(HR 546) to antagonise smooth muscle contracting effect of prostaglandins E2 and F2alpha on isolated preparations of rat and hamster stomach fundus, guinea pig ileum and gerbil colon has been studied. HR 546 was found to be a potent, non-specific, probably competitive, prostaglandin antagonist on these four smooth muscle preparations. 
61	Radioimmunoassay of 5alpha, 7alpha-dihydroxy-11-keto-tetranor-prosta-1,16-dioic acid, main urinary metabolite of prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha-MUM), was performed in normal subjects. Twenty-four hours secretion of PGF2alpha-MUM were 29.04 +/- 9.73 microgram in males and 18.22 +/- 5.88 microgram in females on an average. And an oral administration of aspirin resulted in the remarkable decrease of PGF2alpha-MUM in both sexes. 
62	A health examination survey showed that 5.7% of 2322 middle-aged men had a haematocrit value below 40%. Only 1.2% had two consecutive low values. 14 men had no bone marrow haemosiderin and increased their haematocrits following iron therapy. In 13 men with no cause of the anaemia detected there was also a significant increase in haematocrit following therapy. The true prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia in this population may be estimated to about 1%. 
63	A total of 1,847 serum samples obtained from human subjects in various areas of Nigeria (North, East and West) were tested for the presence of rubella haemagglutination inhibition antibodies. The results showed that an average of 68% of the Nigerian population studied possessed rubella antibody. 
64	Physical loading affects the patterns of cholesterol metabolism in patients with obesity. Content of total cholesterol was altered in blood serum after loading depending on its initial level: it was increased if the initial level was low; if the initial content of cholesterol was high physical loading caused a hypocholesterolemic effect. Level of cholesterol esters was often decreased after loading. Physical loading activated lecithin-cholesterol-acyl transferase in blood plasma. 
65	Organ cultures are a suitable in vitro test--object for pretherapeutical testing of cytostatic resistance on carcinomas of the cervix uteri. The decrease of activity of lactic dehydrogenase and isocitric acid dehydrogenase, determined histochemically, can be used to monitor cytostatic effects at the cultivated tumour. In preparing chemotherapy schedules for advanced cervical carcinomas, cytostatic agents provedly ineffective in vitro should be avoided. 
66	The spontaneous contractility of the rat epididymis was recorded in vivo and the effects of cyproterone acetate were studied. At 7 days after cyproterone acetate daily administration the records of the epididymal contractility did not show significant differences from the records obtained in control animals. On the contrary, in animals injected during 11 days the amplitude and frequency of epididymal contractions showed a significant decrease, and this activity completely ceased at 14 days of treatment. 
67	Methylprednisolone is more effective than prednisolone in mediating long-term cytolysis and immediate inhibition of nucleoside uptake in human lymphoblastoid cells. This suggests that methylation of prednisolone makes it more potent by aiding interaction with a cellular target rather than increasing its stability. 
68	In a large, open, multicentre trial, conducted in general practice, 765 patients suffering from agoraphobia or social phobias were treated with clomipramine (Anafranil, Geigy Pharmaceuticals). Four hundred and eight patients completed a twelve-week course of treatment. Of 285 withdrawals, 139 were due to side-effects. Good results were obtained on all measures of phobias in those patients who completed the study, the improvements being of the order of 70-80%, and over 50% of patients being symptom-free. 
69	The sera from 50 psoriatic patients, 130 patients with other skin diseases and from 24 healthy blood donors were tested for the presence of circulating immune complexes. By means of the 125I-C1q deviation test a positive result was obtained in 70% of the sera from psoriatic patients as compared to 8% in the healthy controls. 
70	Patients undergoing maintenance haemodialysis exhibited at a regular level of ascorbic acid in plasma a decreased concentration of ascorbic acid in leukocytes. Therefore, the ascorbic acid should be administered in a high dosage to patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis, in order to prevent a vitamin-C deficiency in leukocytes. 
71	A 30-year-old veteran heroin addict being treated with methadone maintenance suffered renal failure. He underwent haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and cadaveric renal transplantation while being maintained on methodone. This report illustrates long-term treatment of heroin addicts with renal failure. 
72	On the basis of an analysis of the clinical condition and electromyographic changes in 9 patients treated with Lioresal and 3 controls attention is called to the favourable effect of Lioresal in hemiparesis of cerebral origin. Lioresal was given in daily doses of 50 mg and no unfavourable side effects were observed. Reduction of muscular hypertonia and improvement of general motor activity was obtained. 
73	Buformin at a concentration of 1--2.5 mM stimulates solubilized carnitine palmitoyltransferase by reducing the inhibitory effect of palmitoyl-CoA. Neither buformin nor metformin inhibits the solubilized carnitine palmitoyltransferase. 
74	The authors present a method using cerebral tomodensitometry to establish anatomo-clinical correlations in aphasia. They confirm, in their broad lines, the results of previous studies. They stress the importance of the material that could be studied by this method and define the ideal conditions in which future work should be carried out. (Acta neurol. belg., 1977, 77, 351-362). 
75	The rapid disposal of antibody-treated vibrios by peristalsis in whole animal models makes it difficult to obtain clear evidence for a simultaneous intra-intestinal bactericidal effect. In this paper we have re-examined the evidence for direct intra-intestinal killing. We have found that the data can be explained adequately by peristaltic effects without postulating a direct bactericidal action in vivo. 
76	1000 chickens were used to investigate up to 24 weeks under high environmental temperatures the addition of different types (oxytetracycline and oleandomycin) and different levels (5 or 20 ppm) of antibiotics to the basal diet. Supplementation with 20 ppm had--with both types of antibiotics--a marked positive effect on the growth rate and various quality characteristics of the products. The effect was higher in male animals than in females. 
77	Three cases of tropical fish tank granuloma caused by Mycobacterium marinum (balnei) are described. Abundant acid fact bacilli were demonstrated in homogenates prepared from the fish thus providing early confirmation of the suspected clinical diagnosis: acid fast bacilli could not be demonstrated in biopsy material from the patients' lesions through M. marinum grew on culture. The infection responded to oral co-trimoxazole. 
78	A patient with the clinical picture of quadriceps myopathy was shown to have an underlying myositis. Review of the literature showed myositis to be a rare cause of the 'quadriceps syndrome' but it is important to identify this group because they are potentially treatable with corticosteroids. 
79	167 cases of threatened premature birth were treated with Fenoterol, Fenoterol + Verapamil and Ritodrine. In 70-79% of cases a newborn of over 2500 g was achieved. In 70-76% it was possible to prolong the pregnancy for over 7 days and in 61-64% a gestation age of 37 weeks and more was reached. Special attention was paid to the facts as to whether the general side effects of Fenoterol can be antagonized with Verapamil. 
80	The percentage of E-rosettes and active E-rosettes was determined in untreated patients with Hodgkin's disease. All patients had numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes within the normal range (1,200-5,000 lymphocytes/cu mm). The mean percentage of E-rosettes was significantly lower in the patients (55 +/- 15.7) as compared to normal controls (63 +/- 6.7). No difference in the percentage of active E-rosettes was found (36.6 +/- 8.6 in controls versus 40.3 +/- 10.8 in patients). 
81	The results of the pharmacologic study of some synthesized derivatives of carbamic and carbonic acids show that the compounds are biologically active. They are less toxic than imipramine, and exert a marked excitation effect on the central nervous system. Some of the compounds (including PS-1, P-8-Y and PS-4) possess greater antidepressive action than imipramine. 
82	A casus of so-called nodular mesenteric pseudoxanthomatosis (Schaefer) was investigated by a 73 years old woman. This special findings in the mesenteric lymphnodes were interpreted as changes after inflammatory or infectious diseases in the alimentary tract. For the exact designation was proposed the term lymphonodular mesenteric pseudoxanthomatosis. 
83	An account is presented of the experience acquired in the prolonged prednisolone treatment, at 2-day intervals, of 6 patients with Hand-SchĂĽller-Christian disease. A substantial improvement was observed in the basic process, with scarcely any side-effects. On the basis of the literature data and the present findings, glucocorticoid administration every second day is recommended for the treatment of these patients. 
84	Esters of theophylline-7-acetic acid with different amino alcohols were prepared as possible atropine substitutes, together with esters of some hydroxy acids with beta-hydroxyethyl theophylline. Moreover, esters possessing both theophyllinyl and piperazinyl moieties were prepared with the hope that their spasmolytic activity might be increased. Some of the prepared compounds proved to possess atropine-like activity. 
85	36 year old man developed fever and polyarthralgias 1 month after starting allopurinol with leukocytosis [bilirubin 4.7 mg/dL, AST 145 U/L, Alk P 875 U/L] and liver biopsy showing multiple noncaseating granulomas and cholangitis, resolved on stopping and follow up liver biopsy was normal.
86	Among 319 patients with tuberculosis treated with isoniazid and rifampin, 45 [14%] had minor transient ALT elevations and 13 [4%] had ALT >150 U/L; major risk factor was age; acetylator status not associated with ALT elevations overall, but weakly with early high elevations.
87	7 patients with systemic lupus or connective tissue disorder on aspirin [1.8-3.6 g daily] had AST elevations of 160-300 U/L, all asymptomatic, none jaundiced, all resolving within 10 days of stopping.
88	26 year old woman on amodiaquine prophylaxis developed skin abscess, septicemia and white count of 300/µL with no neutrophils; liver tests were “consistent with hepatocellular damage”, but no specifics given.
89	Two patients, one man and one woman both with IgM deficiency, developed elevations in bilirubin [1.9 and 12.7 mg/dL], ALT [135 and 530 U/L] and Alk P [1-2 times ULN] 6 months and two weeks after starting hydralazine, and both had more rapid recurrence on restarting.
90	Among 102 children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis on aspirin, 5% had elevations in ALT [91% when tested serially], usually mild and self-limited, correlating poorly with dose and salicylate levels; excellent example of adaptation.
91	11 children with acute rheumatoid fever given aspirin and followed for AST and salicylate levels; 6 had AST elevations of 20-505 U/L [only with salicylate levels >19.2 mg/dL] and 10 had eosinophilia >600/?L; all asymptomatic.
92	Among 160 patients with psoriasis treated with methotrexate, 92 had a single liver biopsy on therapy of whom 1% had cirrhosis and 7% fibrosis [correlated with alcohol intake and age but not total dose]; among 68 with two liver biopsies on therapy [total dose 175-5568 mg], 21% had cirrhosis and 24% fibrosis, fibrosis correlating with alcohol intake during therapy, obesity and older age, but cirrhosis found almost only in patients with >2 g methotrexate exposure.
93	Study of a family with 4 members with benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis [BRIC], 9 with cholestasis of pregnancy and two with cholestasis on OCCs; one BRIC patient had recurrent episodes of cholestasis during pregnancies; suggesting shared pathogenesis of these three cholestatic syndromes.
94	25 year old woman on OCCs for 6 years presented with several hepatic masses, one resected showed probable adenoma, the other regressed in size during follow up off of OCCs.
95	Overview of the clinical spectrum, diagnosis and therapy of leprosy from the US Public Health Service hospital in Carville, Louisiana discusses use of clofazimine which was an experimental medication at the time and only available from Carville.
96	55 year old woman developed fever and arthralgias [but no rash or eosinophilia] 4 weeks after starting allopurinol [bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL, ALT 140 U/L and Alk P 900 U/L] and biopsy showing granulomas; improved with stopping drug and had normal values and liver histology 3 months later during cholecystectomy.
97	The influence of chronic intrapregnancy hypoxia caused by mother's diseases (toxemia, gravidarum, hypochromic anemia, diabetes) on the brain of a mature newborn has been investigated. Besides the vast damages of the parieto-occipital cortex, Ammon's horn (entorhinal) motor and insula cortex there were also some damages of the cerebellum and the brain stem cells. The damages of the cells in the brain stem seem to be one of the causes of the abnormal perinatal adaption. 
98	Only a small amount of noise caused, combined with a nutritional Mg deficiency, a significant increase of collagen in the myocard of rats. While Mg deficiency or noise each for its own had no effect, the combination of both had a noxious effect. The results of these experiments give a hint to a correlation between collagen-increase in the myocard and an increase of urinal Catecholamine during the same time. 
99	In 6 patients with chronic lymphatic leukaemia receiving subcutaneously purified calf thymus extract a greater frequency of the following processes was observed: 1) increase in the number of smooth-surface lymphocytes (T cells) in scanning electron microscopy, 2) increased number of lymphocytes forming rosettes with uncoated sheep erythrocytes, 3) increased number of lymphocytes showing high activity of acid phosphatase in cytochemical investigations. 
100	The diagnosis of infectious hepatitis was made in a football player at East Carolina University in the 3rd week of fall practice in 1974. Clinical and laboratory evaluation of all persons involved in the program followed. All participants received immune serum globulin. No further cases were identified. Serum chemistry and enzyme levels were determined under uncontrolled conditions. Lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase were generally elevated. 
101	Three patients with miliary tuberculosis developed the adult respiratory distress syndrome. In two patients this complication developed despite treatment with antituberculous drugs. The third patient developed the syndrome, but miliary tuberculosis was not suspected. The presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation in all three cases suggests a possible pathophysiologic relation. Miliary tuberculosis should be considered in patients presenting with adult respiratory distress syndrome of unknown cause. 
102	Acute renal insufficiency developed in three patients receiving chemotherapy for tuberculosis. It is proposed that acute diffuse interstitial nephritis related to the drugs was responsible for the renal injury. Recovery of renal function was slow and incomplete. Physicians administering chemotherapy to patients with tuberculosis must be aware of the potential nephrotoxicity of the common treatment regimens. 
103	Cefamandole readily diffuses from the serum into soft tissue interstitial fluid. The rate of diffusion differs little from that of cephalothin. The concentrations of antibiotic were greater in bile and urine during the entire period of study than is necessary to kill susceptible pathogenic bacteria present in these fluids. 
104	Five male and five female pure-bred White New Zealanders, including newborns and young animals, one, two, and three months of age, were examined. No sex-dependent difference was established for the parameters tested (weight of liver, heart, and adrenal gland). Significant weight differences were found to exist between the age groups. The relative weights of the organs under review declined along with growing age. Correlations were found to exist between the weights of liver, heart, and adrenal gland. 
105	Strong correlations between electric systole (QT time) and calcium-serum concentration can be statistically secured. In this context, all-transistor direct-printing electrocardiographs were used for indirect determination of calcium concentrations with the view to assessing QT time. The approach is described with reference to the need for safe and independent diagnosis of hypocalcaemic hysteroparalysis in concomitance with parturition against the background of industrialised cattle farming. 
106	Under study were the neurons of the cerebellum cortex of adult cats after a right-side transection of the vagus nerve cranially to its ganglion. The neuron structure was studied in frontal 10-20 mu thick paraffin sections stained with thionine after Nissl 1, 2, 10, 20 days and 1, 2, 3 months after operation. Pathomorphological alterations of neurons were revealed in all layers of the cerebellum cortex. The alterations were of bilateral character, but were more pronounced in the operation side. 
107	Diethylstillboestrol, a synthetic and carcinogenic hormone, binds to DNA as a result of incubation with a liver microsomal preparation in vitro and on incubation with primary mouse foetal cells in culture. Enzymic digestion of DNA samples thus prepared gives several covalent deoxyribonucleoside-diethylstilboestrol products from the microsomal system. One of these is produced in small but significant yield in the tissue-culture system. 
108	Experiments were conducted on rabbits immunized intraperitoneally with corpuscular typhoid vaccine; the number of antibody-forming cells in the spleen proved to increase after tha administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)--pyropeneal, and endogenous serum pyrogen (EPS) together with theopylline. The data obtained indicated that the adenylcyclase system played a certain role in the mechanism of the stimulating action of LPS and EPS. 
109	One hundred and seventy-seven plant extracts, representing 163 species of plants and/or fungi, were evaluated in rats to determine their antiinflammatory activity using the carrageenin-induced pedal edema assay. Of the 163 species of plants and/or fungi tested, 17 exhibited between 30--39 per cent inhibition of inflammation, 21 between 40-49 per cent, 15 between 50--59 per cent, four between 60--69 per cent, and two gave greater than 70 per cent inhibition of carrageenin-induced pedal edema. 
110	Out of 51 patients with traumatic intracranial haematoma admitted to a teaching hospital 11 (22%) died undiagnosed, and out of 307 such patients transferred to the West of Scotland Regional Neurosurgical Centre 111 (36%) had been deteriorating for more than 12 hours in another hospital. In two-thirds of these cases the delay was due to an erroneous diagnosis, either of cerebrovascular accident or of alcoholic intoxication. 
111	The detailed pharmacological study of 1-acetyl-4-phenylcyclohexanol (isomer with equatorial hydroxyl - M.G. 6236 - see formula) is reported. This compound was found to have progestin-like activity particularly as regards increase in carbonic anhydrase activity and increase in the proliferative activity of the mucosa of the rabbit uterus. 
112	The authors have had the opportunity to treat eight cases of lip mucocele with intralesional infiltration of Triamcinolone Acetonide (Kenacort). In three cases there was complete regression of the lesion after a variable period of time between the first and the fourth infiltration. In five cases the results were negative. The patients who reacted positively to treatment were followed-up for a year afterwards. 
113	Rifampin is a drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis. In the literature, there are reports of seven patients who became pregnant while taking a combination of rifampin and oral contraceptives. We report an eighth case involving a woman who became pregnant twice on this drug combination. 
114	An autopsied case of the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome did not indicate the specific pathological features except delayed physical development. 2. Xanthine calculi caused by allopurinol administration scattered in the kidneys, brain, thymus, and thyroid glands, but its excretion into urine was not observed during his life. 3. Activities of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) in various tissues indicate complete deficiency, but HGPRT in liver was normal. 
115	Two of three patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria showed pigment deposits with typical red porphyrin fluorescence on liver biopsy specimens. Birefringence of this pigment by polarized light is due to its crystalline nature, as demonstrated by electron microscopy. There was slight portal inflammation in these cases. A liver biopsy specimen from a third patient was normal. 
116	Two patients who had received live rubella vaccine developed diffuse myelitis shortly afterwards. Neither patient fully recovered her motor function. In one patients the time between vaccination and development of neurological signs was rather too short to indicate definitely a causal relation. Nevertheless, the chronological association is suggestive, and other observations of such an association may strengthen the suspicion that rubella vaccination may occasionally cause severe neurological damage. 
117	Two patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis with permanent indwelling peritoneal catheters who developed Candida albicans peritonitis are presented. Both patients were successfully treated with low dose intravenous amphotericin B. Sequential candida precipitin assays were performed and the diagnostic application is discussed. 
118	1. Plasma cadmium and zinc were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry in inferior venal caval or peripheral venous blood in thrity hypertensive patients and fifteen normal subjects. 2. The mean plasma cadium in hypertensive patients was significantly higher than in normal control subjects. 3. The plasma cadmium/zinc ratio was significantly greater in hypertensive patients. 4. There was a significant positive correlation between the plasma cadmium/zinc ratio and the mean arterial blood pressure. 
119	Cholinesterase reactivators - trimedoxim, methoxim and obidoxim - injected in the dose of 20 mg/kg s.c., increase muscle glycogen concentration in normal, but not in adrenalectomized rats. This effect may be in connection with simoultaneously found rise of serum corticosteron level. Trimedoxim decreases adrenaline, methoxim and obidoxim noradrenaline concentration in adrenals. 
120	Acute toxicity induced by DMN was partially prevented by previously administering methyl mercuric chloride (MMC), a chemical inhibitor of the drug metabolizing enzyme system (DMES). We have studied the early changes occurring during the course of DMN-intoxication, namely disaggregation of polysomal profiles and necrosis, evaluated morphologically and by the release of S-GPT. 
121	From the clinical point of view, the classification of drug-induced liver damage into predictable, unpredictable and simulated, has proved useful (Popper and Greim 1973). Forms of jaundice can be predominantly cholestatic or predominantly hepatocellular and can closely imitate an obstructive syndrome or hepatitis. Mixed forms are also frequent. 
122	The authors describe a gas chromatographic method for determing Ethephone residues. Studies on the residual behaviour of Ethephon on sweet cherries showed that the fruits contained 0.88, 1.45 and 1.83 p.p.m. of Ethephon after applications of 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1% Flordimex mixture, respectively. When the same doses were applied to sour cherries, the fruits contained 0.54, 1.12 and 1.44 p.p.m. of Ethephon; and the juices, 0.81, 1.36 and 1.77 p.p.m. 
123	Decreased increases in blood sugar by comparison with control subjects was noted in patients with cirrhosis of the liver after i.v. administration of 1 mg glucagon. Insulin secretion was similar to that observed in the controls. Basal GH values were higher in the liver patients, whereas after glucagon they displayed a gradual and progressive increase with a peak at 60'. No significant differences in GH pattern were noted in the two groups, however. 
124	Intravenous regional anaesthesia in the reduction of Colles' fracture was compared in 70 patients with 55 others who were treated with general anaesthetics. It was found to be easier and to involve a shorter waiting time, not to require patients to be supervised so long during recovery, and after this method it was less frequently necessary for patients to be taken home by ambulance. Its disadvantages were that it took longer, and could not be used for psychiatric patients or children. 
125	Longterm follow-up and counselling of the diabetic patient faces the family doctor with highly specific tasks. The importance of optimum cooperation from the patient is stressed and the method of carrying out periodic checkups is described. The doctor should obtain information about the carbohydrate metabolism from urinary tests performed by the patient himself. Also, the symptoms of late diabetic syndrome should be detected as early as possible. 
126	"The main cause of occurrence of postural reactions in patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis is a deficit of blood circulatory volume as well as cerebrospinal disturbances and ""harmful"" peculiarities of the operative posture. An increase of the circulatory volume by infusion of 0.5-1.0 litres of plasma substituting substances prior to patient's being rendered the operative posture liquidates, to a great extent, postural reactions of the circulatory system. "
127	The authors have studied phytohemagglutinin stimulation of DNA synthesis in leucocytes cultures of the peripheral blood in patients with some malignant osteoplasms and benign tumors, and the influence of plasma factors on this process, as well. In most cases, lymphocytes of patients with malignant tumors were shown to have a considerably decreased, as compared with the control, level of blasttransformation. No such difference was found for leucocytes cultures of patients with benign tumors. 
128	Report of a newborn with massive ascites who developed a severe coagulopathy due to multiple intrinsic and extrinsic clotting factor deficiencies. All deficient coagulation factors were present in measurable quantities in the infant's ascitic fluid. It is postulated that she sustained loss of coagulant proteins by transudation into her peritoneal cavity. A similarly acquired coagulopathy should be suspected in all patients with a known increase in extravascular fluid compartments. 
129	A fluorimetric method for determination of rubomycin in the blood, milk and urine of humans and animals in concentrations of 0.04-20 gamma/ml was developed. After protein precipitation from the biological material with trichloracetic acid and the antibiotic was determined by fluorescence of its borate complex in concentrated sulfuric acid (gammaexcitk = 575, gammaflk = 620 nm). 
130	The destructive action of chlorine on the pathogenic Naegleria fowleri and Acanthamoeba culbertsoni, the nonpathogenic N. gruberi, and an avirulent Acanthamoeba isolate was investigated. N fowleri is somewhat more sensitive to chlorine than N. gruberi, whereas the two Acanthamoeba strains are very resistant. This study yields information needed for the destruction of amoebic cysts in drinking water and swimming pools. It also gives some explanation for the occurence of Acanthamoeba strains in these waters. 
131	In patients with endogenous depression in remission, decline of systolic blood pressure and a statistically significant shortening of pulse time were found. 
132	Administration of 6-OH-DA into the lateral cerebral ventricle did not prevent development of hypertension or influence the effects of administration of tricyclic antidepressant drugs (TA). Injection os 6-OH-DA intraperitoneally prevented development of hypertension, and TA apparently protected against the consequences of administration of 6-OH-DA. 
133	The influence of trypsin- and leukocyte-induced degradation products of albumin on the potency of thiopental action was studied. Degradation products of albumin increased the potency of this drug as evaluated by Lat's test, prolonged the duration of thiopental sleep and potentiated the hypothermic effects of thiopental. Thiopental action under the influence of albumin degradation products did not depend on the changes to accumunlation of this drug in the brain tissue. 
134	The clinical features and plain film findings in 14 patients with pneumatosis coli are described. Nine had oxygen treatment. The plain radiographic appearances are analysed and their value in diagnosis is presented. It is concluded that the plain abdominal radiograph is a simple and effective way of monitoring the progress of patients undergoing oxygen therapy. 
135	The investigation of a number of parameters of nonspecific and specific defense in 13 purulent and 18 mumps meningitides gave no indication of underlying primary immunodeficiencies. Only in the acute phase of mumps meningitis did we find a temporary suppression of cellular immune reactions measured as diminished rate of incorporation of thymidine by phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. 
136	A primary perireticulin amyloidosis is reported in a 14-year-old girl, which showed the symptoms of a steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. The diagnosis was established by biopsies of kidney and rectum. Occurrence of amyloidosis in childhood and the clinical picture are discussed and references to clinical trials carried out are given. 
137	Topical application of Benzoxazole to the inner surface of the ear of the rabbit induced a considerable and histologically verified follicular keratosis. This effect could be intensified by a preceding treatment of the animal with androgens. Vitamin A acid, applied topically, is able to eliminate this follicular keratosis. 
138	Several barbiturates and other anticonvulsant drugs can be analyzed simultaneously as dimethylated derivatives by high-resolution gas chromatography with a solid flash methylation injector. Quantitative determinations were performed on test serum during a quality control scheme. The sensitivity (+/- 0.1 mug/ml) and the accuracy are compatible with the measurement of therapeutic levels of barbiturates. The advantages of the method are discussed. 
139	A simple method was developed to produce 14C-labeled aflatoxin B1 by using the yeastlike phase of Aspergillus parasiticus NRRL 2999. Yeastlike cultures resulted from absence of manganese in a synthetic medium. Sodium acetate-1-14C had a 0.22% average incorporation; sodium acetate-1,2-14C, 0.70%. The average yield of labeled B1 was 10 mg/500 ml medium with an average specific activity of either 63.3 mCi/mole (C-1 label) or 194.3 mCi/mole (C-1, 2 label). 
140	A series of antitumor triazenes in which the members of the series are physicochemically distinct was designed using the cluster analysis approach as proposed by Hansch and his co-workers. The series that resulted was tested against Sarcoma 180 in the mouse and the antitumor activities were analyzed using regression techniques. The structure-activity relations that resulted are discussed in terms of proposed mechanisms of action. 
141	The results of this study of 110 Singapore Chinese with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and 91 controls confirmed the association between the occurrence of HLA antigen Singapore 2 (Sin2) and NPC in the Chinese population, and indicated that their increased risk for NPC was confined to the joint occurrence of Sin 2 and A2 antigens. These findings suggested that the genotype of importance in susceptibility to NPC is the A2-Sin 2 haplotype. 
142	Hemiacidrin is known solvent of renal calculi. Our report concerns its use in 5 cases as the sole medical agent for dissolving pelvic stones and in 6 others to supplement an operation and dissolve postoperative residual concretions. No serious complications were noted in either group. An accurate and safe technique for its use is described. The results of the method are presented. 
143	In patients with Hodgkin's disease the excretion of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides in urine was followed up within the course of 92 chemotherapeutical series with cytostatics of COOP group. In 14-day chemotherapy series, the excretion of deoxycytidine, deoxyuridine, thymidine, and their sum was significantly increased. In this paper the results are analyzed and a possibility of utilization of this finding for the judgment in the clinical course of the disease is considered. 
144	Thirty subjects between 18 and 66 years of age with overt symptoms of depression were followed during treatment with amytryptiline. Daily dose was 75 mg in three parts for a period of three months. Thirteen subjects showed total remission from the tenth week; 15 showed significant improvement from the third week; 2 showed no change. Side effects were mild and required no medical intervention. 
145	Compared with normal individuals, patients with primary open-angle glaucoma have increased prevalences of HLA-B12 and B7 antigens and are more responsive to glucocorticoids. Lymphocytes from both ocular normotensive and glaucomatous individuals with the HLA-B12 antigen require significantly (P less than .02) lower concentrations of prednisolone to inhibit phytohemagglutinin-induced transformation. 
146	Fat embolism from the grossly fatty liver of an infant with kwashiorkor is described. Globules of fat were seen at necropsy in the hepatic veins, in the right atrium and ventricle of the heart and in the pulmonary artery. Sections of the lung showed fat emboli in numerous branches of the pulmonary artery. Examination of lung sections taken at necropsy from 40 patients who had severe kwashiorkor failed to show similar fat embolism. 
147	In a study of 223 consecutive autopsies of subjects older tumours were found in 36 cases (16%) (25/130 males and 11/93 females). Only eight kidneys showed multiple lesions. Renomedullary interstitial cell tumours were correlated with the presence or absence of hypertension and no statistically significant correlation could be demonstrated. The incidence of renomedullary interstitial cell tumours increases with age. 
148	The clinical features of tuberculous peritonitis in 48 Ethiopian patients are discussed. Thirty per cent of patients were afebrile, three fourths had ascites, and fifteen per cent had palpable abdominal masses, and therefore several had been wrongly diagnosed initially as cirrhosis of the liver or malignancy. Peritoneal biopsy, usually possible with local anaesthesia only, appears to be the most reliable method of proving the diagnosis of tuberculous peritonitis. 
149	Plasma and urinary carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) assays were performed in 151 patients with urological tumours. CEA measurement is unreliable in renal cell carcinoma and carcinoma of the prostate. However, CEA-assays permit the diagnosis of bladder tumours. The test is particularly useful in the followup and therapeutic control of patients with carcinoma of the bladder. 
150	Fibrinogen degradation products were examined by plasma protamine paracoagulation test in 235 cases. The test was positive in about 60% of thrombosis of deep veins, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction cases examined. The test was also positive in 23,4% of women taking oral contraceptives who were free of complaints and symptoms. Because of its easy applicability the test is recommended for screening. 
151	353 patients suffering with peripheral lymphangiopathies were observed. In 276 patients with histological examinations, 201 portrayed obliterative LAP. 85% were females, which indicate a ratio of nearly 1:4. The etiologic factors are unknown. A therapeutic trial with a combination of saluretics and small doses of corticoids, is discussed. 
152	The lesions seen in chronic familial granulomatosis are variable and seen in varied combinations: granulomas, often disseminated, pseudotuberculous lesions, histiocytes with a high content in lipofuscins seen in the liver, lymph nodes, spleen and lungs in particular. These lesions may be explained at least in part by a congenital defect in leucocytes, which is peculiar to this hereditary disease, and which concernes bactericidal functions. 
153	We report herein a patient with pulmonary melioidosis, whose initial chest roentgenogram revealed only a pleural mass. The patient had not been in a zone endemic for melioidosis during the previous 15 months. We stress the importance of including melioidosis in the differential diagnosis of pleural lesions, and of considering this diagnosis in any patient who has been in an endemic zone at any time in the past. 
154	A method for the preparation of freeze-dried intestinal villi from hamsters and mice is described. The villi, consisting largely of epithelial cells rich in esterase activity, are useful for hydrolysis studies of penicillin and cephalosporin esters. 
155	"This paper discusses ""juvenile-onset diabetes"", which is a condition that can begin at any time during the life span. The condition is understood to mean that type of diabetes in which there is absolute insulin deficiency, and where insulin therapy is required. "
156	Veno-occlusive disease of the liver is caused by the hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloid fulvine which is found in the plant Crotolaria fulva. Histological, histochemical and electronmicroscopic studies carried out in Wistar rats showed that an aqueous solution of fulvine produced an acute pancreatopathy with interstitial oedema and secondary hypoxic dystrophy of the acinar cells, when administered at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg body weight. 
157	The studies in the English language of the treatment of latent syphillis suffer from a variety of problems. Investigators have failed to define cases adequately and, in some instances, have combined results of several treatment regimens, and have not followed patients for an adequate period of time. It may be wisest to recommend that regimens considered effective for asymptomatic neurosyphilis also be used for latent syphilis. 
158	A case of organizing hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade in a patient with a permanent endocardial pacemaker who was maintained on anticoagulation is presented. The hemopericardium is concluded as solely due to the anticoagulation. A new auscultatory finding attributable to an endocardial pacemaker and a helpful radiographic sign of pericardial effusion in patients with these pacemakers is described. 
159	The pharmacological action of glucagon in the regulation of systemic and mesenteric district haemodynamics, in line with the approach that has come to the fore in recent years for treating haemorrhagic shock with vasodilators, suggested a study of the effects of glucagon on mesenteric haemodynamics during haemorhagic shock in dogs. It was shown that the infusion of glucagon increases mesenteric arterial flow and peripheral resistances are reduced without particular systemic modifications. 
160	Two men with leukemia, ages 17 and 72 years, developed abdominal pain, ascites and progressive liver failure 3-4 months after starting cyclic cytotoxic therapy with multiple agents including thioguanine [initial bilirubin 1.3 and 2.5 mg/dL, AST 348 and 48 U/L, Alk P 92 and 276 U/L]; autopsies showed acute sinusoidal obstruction syndrome [veno-occlusive disease].
161	Prospective study of 218 psychiatric inpatients with latent tuberculosis treated with isoniazid for 1 year and 140 controls; AST values above 30 U/L were present in 3% before and 10-12% on therapy [at least 1 abnormal value in 38% of treated vs 15% of controls]; 3 patients became jaundiced [bilirubin 2.5-5.3 mg/dL], but none developed frank hepatitis and many resolved despite continuing isoniazid [adaptation], persistent abnormalities in only 2; no predictive factors: Cases 1 and 2.
162	Review of the frequency and clinical features of viral hepatitis in injection drug users, including the frequency of chronic hepatitis and history of multiple bouts of hepatitis, only one of which is associated with HBsAg positivity.
163	Among 189 outpatients treated for latent tuberculosis, AST elevations occurred in 21% of adults [1 jaundiced] and 6% of children; 11% were symptomatic, AST elevations persisted after stopping in some patients.
164	Open label study of parenteral clindamycin therapy in 41 patients including 24 with preexisting liver disease; AST levels rose in 5 patients with liver disease and improved in others; among 17 patients without liver disease, AST levels rose in 4 [52, 57, 60 and 270 U/L], but elevations were self-limited and resolved spontaneously.
165	Among 18 baboons treated with chenodiol [18-38 mg/kg daily], 15 [83%] had ALT or AST elevations, most of whom had “significant” histologic changes, similar to those described for lithocholic acid.
166	Classic review of halothane hepatitis; 26 patients, 25 adults, 69% women, often obese, 92% previously exposed, symptom onset in 1-12 days, jaundice rapidly following, AST markedly elevated, Alk P minimally increased, bilirubin 3.2-41.2 mg/dL; 42% fatal, no chronicity; striking demonstration of fever with previous exposures and acceleration of latency.
167	78 year old woman developed abdominal pain and anorexia 12 months after starting daily nitrofurantoin [peak bilirubin 7.8 mg/dL, AST 930 U/L, ANA >1:1600], resolving within 2 months of stopping, but ANA still weakly positive one year later [1:25].
168	In a weighted random sample of the specially enumerated population of a South Wales industrial town, examined by cholecystography for gallstones, the overall prevalence rates were 6.2 per cent for men 45 to 69 years of age and 12.1 per cent for women of the same ages. Contrary to our expectation there was no marked increase in prevalence with age in either sex. Symptoms of dyspepsia said to be suggestive of gallstones were found with approximately equal frequency in those with and without gallbladder disease.
169	58 year old woman developed nausea and jaundice 5 months after starting tamoxifen for breast cancer [bilirubin 14.3 mg/dL, ALT 1155 U/L], with progressive worsening and death 7 weeks later, autopsy showing massive necrosis.
170	913 patients with HIV infection on zidovudine were randomized to switch to didanosine [500 or 750 mg/day] or continue zidovudine; pancreatitis occurred in 7% and 13% of didanosine, but only 3% of zidovudine-treated patients; no mention of ALT levels of hepatotoxicity.
171	Initial report on use of nitisinone in humans; 5 children with type 1 tyrosinemia received nitisinone in doses of 0.1-0.6 mg/kg daily which led to clinical improvements in all including resolution of liver and renal abnormalities; “no side effects were encountered”.
172	Summary of adverse event profile in 2818 patients on long term omeprazole found low rate of side effects, similar in frequency to those on ranitidine or cimetidine; no mention of ALT elevations, hepatitis or jaundice.
173	69 year old woman developed jaundice 10 weeks after starting glyburide [bilirubin 6.9 mg/dL, ALT 405 U/L, Alk P 610 U/L], subsequently progressing to hepatic failure and death, possibly due to delayed stopping of drug.
174	Review of Danish adverse effects reports between 1968-81; 53 disulfiram hepatic injury cases found, onset after 16-120 days, 11 fatal; death rate estimated as 1: 25,000 treatment-years.
175	1. The effects of caffeine on the NADPH-dependent production of paracetamol-glutathione conjugate were studied in rat and mouse liver microsomes. 2. In the presence of caffeine, glutathione conjugate production in rat microsomes was enhanced, whereas that in mouse microsomes was not affected significantly, showing an apparent species difference. 3. The data partly explain the species difference in the effects of caffeine on paracetamol hepatotoxicity. 
176	Serum ceruloplasmin levels were estimated in 81 patients within one week after an attack of acute myocardial infarction. A total of 126 healthy subjects were taken as controls and investigated for this copper containing protein. Results showed that there is an elevation in the levels of serum ceruloplasmin in patients as compared to the controls. Ceruloplasmin levels showed a return to almost normal values in 54 follow-up cases of acute myocardial infarction during the fourth week after infarction. 
177	We report a case of intrarenal arteriovenous fistula (AVF) with macroscopic hematuria detected after nephrolithotomy performed 25 years previously. The present case, successfully treated by transcatheter embolization with steel coils, is the eighth case of postnephrolithotomy AVF reported in English and Japanese literatures. The necessity of renal arteriography in patients with postoperative massive hematuria is stressed. 
178	Blood transfusions were not performed intra- or postoperatively in 10 patients operated on for acquired heart valve defects under perfusion-free hypothermia (PFH). The otherwise favourable postoperative period was characterized by a moderate decrease in hemoglobin level and red blood cell count. No complications have been observed. It has been concluded that the volume of the blood transfused can be considerably reduced or in some cases there can be no transfusions at all during surgery under PFH. 
179	Intra-oral pyogenic granulomas have been associated with pregnancy. The exaggerated response of these tumors has been related to the hormonal changes occurring during this period. A change in the hormonal balance also occurs during puberty. In this paper, we present two young patients with large pyogenic granulomas and suggest that the hormonal changes play a primary role in the pathogenesis of this tumor. 
180	"For 11 patients with ocular malignant melanoma (OMM) suspicion, before and after laser photocoagulation therapy, by E rosette test were studied. A higher activation and sensitisation to OMM antigen was obtained after laser therapy in 9 patients. These results suggest the influence of laser treatment on lymphocyte function by ""revealing"" the physiological reactivity. Our results point out the ""functional"" E rosette test is useful for OMM diagnosis and therapy, as an indicator for disease prognosis. "
181	In acute septic arthritis, the synovial fluid is usually frankly purulent. However, the presence of pus does not always imply the presence of infection, and some synovial fluids are easily mistaken for pus. An exaggeration of the normal leucocyte response in inflammatory joint fluids may alone simulate sepsis; marked increases in certain lipid fractions of the fluid may produce similar appearances. We describe a patient who presented with two examples of such 'pseudoseptic arthritis'. 
182	An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for erythropoietin determination has been established by using two kinds of monoclonal antibodies with specific affinities to erythropoietin. Besides being rapid (2.5 h) and sensitive (detection limit 0.3 int. unit/L), the present method gives accurate results and is easy to perform. The method may be clinically applicable for discriminative diagnosis of polycythemia and analyses of various anemic conditions. 
183	This paper reports the results of a postal questionnaire survey to ascertain the current status of NHS hospital services for patients with tinnitus. Statistics are given on the various managements used, e.g. about two-thirds of consultants prescribe tinnitus maskers. A total of 66 tinnitus clinics have been identified. The data are interpreted as illustrative of the steady improvements in the last 10-15 years in tinnitus management services. 
184	1. Aminopeptidase C was purified from porcine skeletal muscle. 2. The mol. wt of the enzyme was found to be 103,000 on both Sephadex G-200 column chromatography and SDS-PAGE. 3. The optimum pH for the hydrolysis of L-leucine p-nitroanilide was around 7.0. 4. The activity of this enzyme was strongly inhibited by EDTA, bestatin and puromycin. 5. The enzyme acted on the beta-naphthylamide derivatives of amino acids and oligopeptides. 
185	The effects of the running pulse magnetic field, antianginal drug therapy and their combinations on the physical capacity were compared in 60 patients with Functional Classes I-III stable angina pectoris. Monotherapy with the running pulse magnetic field was found to produce an antianginal effect in patients with Functional Classes I-II angina pectoris, but the efficacy of drug therapy increased when antianginal drugs were used in combination with running pulse magnetic field in patients with severe angina. 
186	The present state of bacilli excretion in the Yakut area and its certain social aspects are characterized, the detection rate of M. tuberculosis in pulmonary tuberculosis and the sex-age structure are subjected to analysis. Data on the primary and secondary drug resistance, type appertainance of the causative agent and the result of a disinfectant work in the infection foci have been studied in 511 patients having copious bacilli excretion. 
187	In rats trained to discriminate 0.8 mg/kg IP d-amphetamine from 1 ml/kg saline, 4 x 10(6) U/kg of recombinant human interferon-alpha (rIFN-alpha) given intramuscularly 1 h prior to tests potentiated responses elicited by 0.4 mg/kg d-amphetamine. Coadministration of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg IP) with rIFN-alpha suppressed the potentiation of d-amphetamine by the cytokine. Opioid-dopaminergic mechanisms are proposed to explain the action of rIFN-alpha. 
188	In this study we evaluated in open the efficacy and tolerability of the preconstituted association Captopril 50 mg + Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, for a six-month period, in a population of 201 aged patients affected by isolated systolic hypertension. The results showed a good antihypertensive efficacy of the association Captopril-Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and also an optimal safety of use. 
189	3 syngeneic tumor-mouse systems were used to establish experimental model of liver metastasis. Only one system, SC42-DS, was suitable for the purpose. When 2 x 10(5) SC42 tumor cells was injected into the spleen of DS mouse and splenectomy was done after 24 hours preventing of spleen tumor due to implantation, multiple nodular liver metastasis were observed in all mice after 14 days. The numbers of nodulus were well correlated with the liver weight. 
190	Arthrosis and back troubles together account for at least a third of all rheumatic suffering, and they are much the commonest rheumatological causes of impairment and disability. In contrast to the inflammatory arthropathies, one cannot help but be struck by the fact that research endeavour has not been commensurate with the burden that has to be endured. 
191	An HIV-positive man with subacute syphilitic meningitis developed severe bilateral visual loss from optic neuritis. His visual acuity improved remarkably within 24 hours after single posterior sub-Tenon's injections of triamcinolone (Kenalog) were given. Periocular steroid injections should be considered as an adjunctive treatment of syphilitic optic neuritis. 
192	Cancer affects the family as well as the patient. The home is a primary site of care, which often must be intensive and complex. Attention to home care of the cancer patient is therefore a major concern in maintaining quality of life for both patient and family. The authors explore the major burdens of home care that affect both patient and family and describe four specific interventions that the health care team can initiate to optimize quality of life in these difficult situations. 
193	The purpose of this article is to describe the phenomenon of postanesthesia shaking (PS) and discuss its significance to the patient recovering from anesthesia, and to review the literature on the subject. Based on this review, future studies are recommended to replicate previous work, and to provide a more comprehensive picture of PS. Results of research may determine further treatment for PS. 
194	The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the immunomodulator dehydroepiandrosterone in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in glucocorticoid-induced immunosuppressed rats. A significant reduction in cryptosporidial activity occurred in treated versus untreated rats as assessed by oocyst shedding intensities and examination of parasite colonization in the small intestine. 
195	46 year old man with HIV infection who received multiple courses of fluconazole, developing serum enzyme elevations when dose was increased to 200 mg daily [bilirubin not mentioned, ALT 100-500 U/L, Alk P 300-500 U/L].
196	67 year old woman developed cough, lung infiltrates and then jaundice 2 years after starting daily nitrofurantoin [bilirubin 7.6 rising to 14.6 mg/dL, ALT 1184 U/L, Alk P 203 U/L, ANA 1:640], resolving slowly upon stopping.
197	69 year old man with prostate cancer developed pulmonary toxicity [interstitial pneumonitis] 2 months after starting nilutamide with concurrent minor enzyme abnormalities [bilirubin 0.50 mg/dL, ALT 96 U/L, Alk P 150 U/L], which resolved rapidly with stopping: Case 2.
198	66 year old man developed symptoms and jaundice after 1 day of starting ciprofloxacin [bilirubin 10.9 mg/dL, ALT 2608 U/L, Alk P 269 U/L] with shock, lactic acidosis and death 7 days later.
199	72 patients with porphyria cutanea tarda were treated with hydroxychloroquine 250 mg thrice daily for 3 days; AST elevations occurred during first few days, some rising above 1000 U/L, bilirubin rising above normal in ~30%, all resolving.
200	A 99mTc-MDP bone scan performed on a 52-yr-old female for possible bone metastasis revealed prominent hepatic uptake. Subsequently, a 99mTc-SC scan revealed tracer uptake in the caudate lobe with diminished uptake in the remainder of the liver. Further imaging with Doppler ultrasound and hepatic venography confirmed a diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome. Hepatic necrosis, demonstrated on CT imaging, was secondary to Budd-Chiari syndrome and was felt to be the cause of 99mTc-MDP hepatic uptake in this patient. 
201	Intracerebral hemorrhage complicating anticoagulant-thrombolytic therapy for myocardial infarction is infrequent but is associated with grave prognostic implications. We report two cases and review current management recommendations. 
202	The synthesis of five chlorobenzyl benzylidene imidazolidinediones and four fluorobenzyl benzylidene thiazolidinediones is described. In order to investigate their antimicrobial activity they are evaluated against microorganism such as Candida albicans, Neurospora crassa, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Escherichia coli. 
203	The effect of treatment with the cholecystokinin antagonist L364,718 on intake of different dilutions of corn oil emulsion was tested under two levels of familiarity with the oil emulsion. No increase in intake was observed. To see if the CCK antagonist was effective under our conditions, exogenous CCK was administered under the same conditions. A complete suppression of the large reduction produced by CCK on intake was found. 
204	56 year old woman developed fever and jaundice 2.5 weeks after taking 2 doses of nitrofurantoin [bilirubin 11.4 rising to 32.4 mg/dL, ALT 3355 U/L, Alk P 215 U/L, protime 16 sec], and subsequent medical history identified a similar bout of hepatitis [bilirubin 21.8 mg/dL, ALT 470 U/L, Alk P 225 U/L] 3 months after starting nitrofurantoin 17 years earlier.
205	Immunological monitoring of cystic hydatid patients undergoing medico-surgical management has revealed that it is possible to assess individual host responses throughout therapy and subsequently be guided by the results obtained. The analysis has involved the demonstration of variation in haemagglutination antibodies, specific IgG and IgM immunoglobulins and circulating immune complexes before, during, and months after albendazole therapy. 
206	A 6-year (1985-1990) retrospective survey of raccoons with canine distemper infection and an outbreak of the disease in 1988 on South Island, South Carolina, are described. During this epizootic, 3 male raccoons with the clinical disease had gross testicular lesions that, on histopathologic examination, revealed severe diffuse degeneration and mineralization of seminiferous tubules. The testicular pathology of canine distemper in raccoons has not been previously reported. 
207	A 40-year-old male presenting with exercise-induced headaches was found to have a pheochromocytoma which was subsequently removed. His blood pressure was never recorded as elevated. He went on to develop recurrence of asthma, which had been absent for at least 20 years, 48 h postoperatively. This is the first case of pheochromocytoma manifesting as exercise-induced headache in the absence of detectable hypertension. 
208	Two cases of scintigraphically detected asymptomatic graft anastomotic pseudoaneurysms are reported. Both patients previously underwent simultaneous renal and pancreatic transplantation. The role of imaging in the diagnosis of this relatively rare, but potentially lethal, vascular complication of pancreatic transplantation is discussed. This is the first report of anastomotic pseudoaneurysms in pancreatic transplants being diagnosed by scintigraphy. 
209	In severely burned children, depending on severity of injury, the anti-triptic activity of blood serum, alpha 2-macroglobulin level, fibronectin, activity of an arginase decrease at the acute period of toxemia and septic toxemia. The content of the products of fibrin-fibrinogen degradation increases considerably. Alteration of the indices studied is of informative value and is associated with dynamics of the toxic syndrome development. Use of donor antiproteic plasma has a positive therapeutic effect. 
210	We describe clinical and neuroradiologic findings in a male infant with congenital hydrocephalus born to a mother who developed human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy. Ultrasonography at age 20 days showed multiple cysts in the subependymal germinal matrix and enlarged lateral ventricles. Elevation of serum HTLV-I antibody suggested that his hydrocephalus was probably due to intrauterine HTLV-I infection. HTLV-I may cause neurotropic infection in utero. 
211	A successfully treated case of cyclophosphamide pneumonitis, which developed during treatment for a leukemic phase of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is documented. Subtyping of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid easily excluded a possible diagnosis of pulmonary involvement of lymphoma. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a useful approach to determine the correct etiology of pneumonitis. 
212	Using radioligand binding assay, we measured the Bmax and Kd of glucocorticoid membrane binding sites (GCMBS) in the synaptic plasma membranes isolated from different regions of porcine brain. The Kds of GCMBS in cerebrum, cerebellum, midbrain, thalamus, nuclei caudatus and hypothalamus are all around 200 nmol/L. The Bmax of GCMBS in the mentioned brain regions ranges from 218.98 fmol/mg to 486.95 fmol/mg protein. 
213	An experimental diabetes model was produced by intravenous injection of alloxan. Verapamil (40 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally 30 minutes prior to alloxan was able to decrease serum glucose from 22.93 +/- 1.37 mmol/L to 8.79 +/- 0.83 mmol/L after 48 hours of injection of alloxan. Histological findings showed that the number of secretory granules in beta cells of the pancreatic islet of rats pretreated with verapamil was markedly increased as compared to rats treated with alloxan alone. 
214	Exposition of one case of skin metastasis in a 35 year-old patient, diagnosed 10 years previously with epithelioid sarcoma of the penis, which was treated with total penectomy. The singularity of this case lies in the rarity of a pineal site for this tumour, as well as the infrequency of the skin metastasis. It should be noted the significance of long-term follow-up in this patients, since quite frequently they develop metastasis following a long asymptomatic period. 
215	In a retrospective review covering 16 years divided into two time periods, 133 patients with amebic liver abscess were evaluated. Most of the patients were young, Hispanic men, and one-third had coexistent disease. A reliable diagnosis can be established in 24 hours using ultrasound or computed tomography scans. Over the entire time period, antiparasitic therapy was evolved to occupy a primary role and surgery was reserved for management of abscess complications. 
216	Because transesophageal echocardiography is invasive, it has the potential for serious complications. Limitations occur because of the restricted transducer mobility within transducers for special situations. Pitfalls (potential erroneous diagnoses resulting from misinterpretation of normal and abnormal anatomy) are prevalent with this new technology. This report critically reviews transesophageal echocardiography and discusses and illustrates commonly encountered limitations, pitfalls, and complications. 
217	The novel anthelmintic cyclodepsipeptide PF1022A was isolated from cultured mycelia of Mycelia Sterilia PF1022 (FERM BP-2671). It showed strong anthelmintic activities against Ascaridia galli in chickens. The structure of PF1022A was determined to be cyclo(D-lactyl-L-N-methylleucyl-D-3-phenyllactyl-L-N-meth ylleucyl-D-lactyl-L-N- methylleucyl-D-3-phenyllactyl-L-N-methylleucyl) by spectroscopic analyses and chemical studies. 
218	Infants with the short-bowel syndrome are living longer and are increasing in number due to new medical treatments and a larger number of survivals with very low birth weights. This article reviews the medical and nursing management of these infants. A case study of an infant with the short-bowel syndrome is presented with a detailed nursing care plan emphasizing the physical, emotional, and social care of these infants. 
219	Contraceptive steroid treatment accounted for about a 30 per cent decrease in the number of thymic glucocorticoid receptors of adult rats. Neonatal allylestrenol treatment had no influence on that treatment. The activity of the hepatic microsomal (PSMO) enzyme system was not changed by the contraceptive treatment. It appears that contraceptive treatment may account for overlaps on receptors in adulthood. 
220	The most important word-wide and home trends of osteoporosis and age-related fractures are reviewed. The author summarizes the relationship between fractures and bone mass, the bone mass determinants and the risk factors for osteoporosis. He describes the secular trends, age- and sex specific incidence as well as geographic distribution of fractures of the proximal femur, vertebrae and distal forearm. Finally the social and financial impact of this major public health problem are discussed. 
221	With the last two decades, the importance of genetic factors in the aetiology of major mental illness has been firmly re-established and psychiatric research has now firmly embraced the era of molecular genetics. Despite a number of false starts in the study of schizophrenia and affective disorder, there have been successes in unmasking some of the aetiological secrets of Alzheimer's disease. We will give an overview of the rationale behind these studies and the major findings to date. 
222	"Thorough review of antiviral activity, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of foscarnet; ""Foscarnet has negligible effects on hepatic function, only occasionally causing slight elevations in serum transaminase levels""."
223	71 year old man with heart failure after a myocardial infarction, developed enzyme elevations 2 days after captopril was started [peak bilirubin 1.3 mg/dL, ALT 135 U/L, Alk P 450 U/L, GGT 780 U/L], resolving within 4 weeks of stopping.
224	Infection is a frequent problem affecting cysto-peritoneal shunts, the usual causative organisms being Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus. Fungi are rarely isolated from such infections. We present the first report, as far as the authors are aware, of a case of Trichosporon beigelii shunt infection that responded to shunt removal and antifungal therapy. 
225	A biologically active synthetic peptide, 2438, representing the 124-138 amino acid sequence of the human interferon alpha-2 (IFN alpha-2) molecule, which is known to possess IFN-like antiproliferative activity, specifically binds to human blood leukocytes. Scatchard plots reveal two different Kd values, for the 'low' and 'high' affinity binding. The interaction of the 125I-labelled peptide 2438 with the cells is not impaired by human IFN alpha-2 or cholera toxin. 
226	Inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen in a 50-year-old man was encountered in our surgical clinic. This splenic tumor is very rare and in the ninth of the cases in the literature. The removed spleen, weighting 255g, revealed the presence of a firm, circumscribed mass, measuring 4.5 x 4.0 x 4.5 cm, and histologically presenting marked lamination of collagen fibers around the small vessels associated with granulomatous lesions. The implications of its pathogenesis was analyzed with a review of the literature. 
227	A lognormal double-peak pattern of ascorbic acid content distribution within rat daily urine and the presence in the population of vitamin C hypo-, hyper-, and normally producing individuals have been established. Radiation-induced changes in the C-vitamin status of rats during their lifetime were assessed by average geometrical levels of acid excretion. A 1.5-3-fold decrease in providing vitamin C producing animals with vitamin C was demonstrated a year after intrapulmonary incorporation of 239PuO2. 
228	Embryos of the Sea Urchin Paracentrotus lividus were incubated for different periods of time in various concentrations of Zinc-ethylenebisdithiocarbamate (ZINEB) in artificial (or natural) sea water. Dramatic developmental modifications have been observed after 48 hour treatment with 0.4 ug/ml ZINEB solution. The abnormalities concern the formation of spiculae. 
229	Treatment of biliary ileus is still controversial in respect of surgical strategy. While some surgeons have agreed enterolithotomy as a simple and safe operation, others prefer to perform enterolithotomy, cholecystectomy and repair bilio-enteric fistula at the same time. The authors examine their experience and discuss various modalities of treatment to identify the rational method of therapy in these patients. 
230	The problems caused by malnutrition in postoperative complications are well know as is the importance of parenteral nutrition (NP). Thanks to the improvement in instruments and methods, NP can be used not only in intensive therapy departments, but also in less well equipped ones. The Authors report their experience of the use of NP in 77 patients from January 1978 to December 1989 treated in the Surgical Department of the Civil Hospital of Susa (TO), USSL 36, Regione Piemonte. 
231	Effect of the 14-day administration of piracetam in a dose of 5 g/kg ip upon the behavior of rats and on the content of biogenic amines and their metabolites in different brain areas was studied. It was shown that the treatment by PI for 14 days produced changes in the rat behavior manifested mainly by inhibition of exploratory activity. Long-term PI administration modified the content of NA, DA and 5-HT and their metabolites in different parts of the brain. 
232	The authors analyze their experience with 247 hemosorptions in 163 patients with acute exogenous poisonings. Indications and contraindications to hemosorption in these patients are described. Methodical aspects of hemosorption are described: vascular approaches, apparatus, prehemosorption care, regimens of hemosorption. Hemosorption may be associated with hemodialysis, hemofiltration, ultraviolet irradiation of the blood. 
233	A study is presented of the clinico-hemodynamic efficacy of mildronate in 38 patients with ischemic stroke. The drug produces a positive inotropic effect on the myocardium, improves the cerebral hemodynamics in patients with stroke and postischemic hypo- and hyperperfusion of the brain tissue. It is concluded that mildronate may be recommended for the complex treatment of ischemic disorders of the cerebral circulation. 
234	Among the 21,341 blood donors who gave their blood in 1990, 638 were anti-HBc positive. There is a significant difference between men and women who are 18 to 22 years old and those who are more than 50 years old. In the first case, this difference can be referred to the heterogeneity of the male population and in the second case, to the aftermath of military campaigns. 
235	We describe the clinical course of a patient with pregnancy-related, acquired, pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). The course of PRCA was prolonged and ultimately responded only to corticosteroids. It did not recurr over 4 years of observation despite another gestation, and no other cause for PRCA could be detected during this long period. 
236	Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity was detected in larvae of the Australian sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina, and in the nematode Haemonchus contortus. A specific inhibitor of the enzyme was shown to affect survival of both species of parasite in vitro. GST from both parasites has been purified and partially characterized. Antisera raised to the purified enzymes were shown to inhibit the enzyme activity in vitro. However, the antisera had no effect on the survival of either parasite. 
237	Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is available in the United States for parenteral use. We report a preliminary trial of DHE suppositories in an outpatient headache clinic setting. Dihydroergotamine suppositories may be appropriate for patients with catamenial migraine and classic migraine in particular. 
238	The experience with the use of gravitation plasmapheresis in treatment of patients with jaundice of different genesis is summarized. A technique for performance of plasmapheresis in patients with parenchymatous and obstructive jaundice, number of the manipulations performed, volume of plasma removed, dynamics of normalization of the biochemical indices of the blood of the patients are presented. 
239	Malignant hemangioendothelioma of the liver (MHL) is of great interest for epidemiologists in view of its scanty and well-defined etiological factors. The paper presents epidemiological data on MHL in the Trieste area obtained at 46050 autopsies performed in 1969-1988. The results confirm the inference on extremely rare occurrence of MHL sporadic forms, each new case being indicative of emergence of new environmental or occupational oncogenic factors in relevant area. 
240	The authors investigated some immunologic parameters in 17 patients treated with CAPD during 11.0 +/- 6.8 months. There were no disturbances in humoral immunity. In cell-mediated immunity we observed only skin anergy specially in patients with high peritonitis rate. In this group we observed lower concentration of IgG, C3 complement and fibronectin in peritoneal effluent. 
241	Among 24 patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy with busulfan, cyclophosphamide and etoposide, 4 [17%] developed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome which was fatal in one.
242	Review of doxazosin soon after its approval in the United States; doxazosin has more effect on standing than supine blood pressure and side effects include dizziness, syncope, sexual dysfunction and nervousness; no mention of liver toxicity or ALT elevations.
243	41 year old man with psoriasis had mild fluctuations in serum AST during etretinate therapy ultimately [at 9 months] rising to 361 U/L, without jaundice or symptoms and resolving rapidly with discontinuation.
244	Infusion of FUDR into the portal vein of dogs resulted in ALT, Alk P and bilirubin elevations similar to that seen with hepatic artery infusions; however, no biliary strictures were seen, indicating direct toxicity to the central bile ducts rather than toxicity of a metabolite excreted in bile.
245	60 patients given etodolac [200 mg twice daily] or piroxicam [20 mg once daily] for 12 weeks with blood chemistries done at start and stop of therapy; “There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters in either treatment group”.
246	"Among 129 patients with CGD treated with interferon gamma [50 µg per square meter] or placebo subcutaneously 3 times weekly for up to a year, those receiving interferon had fewer serious infections; side effects of interferon gamma included fever, headache, and chills with initial injections but led to no serious adverse events or changes in ""biochemical indexes""."
247	PIIIP levels were assessed in 170 patients with psoriasis being treated with methotrexate; levels were usually elevated in those with psoriatic arthritis [38% without fibrosis], but elevations in those with psoriasis alone were reliable markers for fibrosis or cirrhosis on liver biopsy [67% of 24] vs nonspecific or normal findings [4% of 52]; no correlation between ALT and PIIIP levels.
248	73 year old woman with multiple medical problems developed biliary colic and pancreatitis [peak amylase 513 U/L] after 12 days of iv ceftriaxone for Klebsiella sepsis, with mild elevations in Alk P [299 U/L] and ALT [252 U/L], but no jaundice, resolving once ceftriaxone was stopped: Case 1.
249	Retrospective analysis of 82 patients treated with niacin for dyslipidemia from 1987-90; none of 65 on regular niacin but 8 of 15 on sustained release niacin [4 different brands] developed liver injury, even in low doses; mostly hepatocellular [ALT 810-970 U/L, Alk P 56-2325 U/L], all but one hepatocellular, one jaundiced, all recovered.
250	16 year old girl with chronic hepatitis B developed rise in ALT levels after 2 months of interferon therapy, resolving with stopping but recurring with restarting, with rises in anti-LKM and need for prolonged prednisone therapy to control enzyme elevations.
251	"Editorial on hepatotoxicity of long term, low dose methotrexate therapy stressed the lack of progression of fibrosis found in many publications and that 0-22% of patients had fibrosis and 0-1.5% had cirrhosis even before therapy; ""the balance of evidence indicates that the risk of liver damage is small""."
252	18 year old female developed jaundice 3 weeks after taking 2 tablets of ecstasy [bilirubin 15.6 mg/dL, ALT 44 times ULN, GGT 1.4 times ULN, protime 96%], with subsequent worsening and liver biopsy showing chronic hepatitis with bridging fibrosis; one year later enzymes were normal, but repeat liver biopsy showed chronic hepatitis with mild fibrosis.
253	58 year old man developed jaundice 7 months after starting phenprocoumon, which improved upon stopping but recurred within 4 weeks of restarting [bilirubin 8.1 mg/dL, ALT 589 U/L, Alk P 208 U/L, 5% eosinophils], which resolved within 3 months of switching to heparin; the initial episode had been mistakenly attributed to non-A, non-B hepatitis.
254	26 year old woman with HIV infection on zidovudine for 1 year developed fever and cough and was given aspirin [3 g/day], developed lethargy and abnormal liver tests 12 days later with progressive liver failure and death; macrovesicular fat considered typical of Reyes syndrome found on liver biopsy.
255	3 patients, ages 52-73 years, developed jaundice 1-5 months after starting etoposide with several other cyclic antineoplastic agents including cisplatin and cyclophosphamide in two [bilirubin 4.2-13.0 mg/dL, ALT 790-2270 U/L, Alk P 181-280 U/L], resolving in 4-10 weeks and no recurrence on a similar regimen without etoposide in one patient.
256	67 year old man with polymyositis developed jaundice 3 months after starting azathioprine [bilirubin ~5.0 mg/dL, ALT ~120 U/L, Alk P 550 U/L], liver biopsy showing intrahepatic cholestasis and bile duct injury; resolving within 2 months of stopping.
257	37 year old woman with AIDS developed hepatomegaly 11 months after starting ketoconzaole [bilirubin not mentioned, ALT 116 U/L, Alk P 180 U/L], liver biopsy showing fatty liver; also on zidovudine, a more likely candidate to cause this pattern of liver injury.
258	Two patients developed anemia due to zinc; a 31 year old schizophrenic man swallowed multiple coins and presented with nausea and abdominal pain with subsequent severe anemia resolving within 4 weeks; a 48 year old man on chronic zinc supplements developed fatigue and severe anemia, resolving within 2 weeks of stopping zinc intake; no mention of liver injury.
259	In clinical trials, 31 of 3,302 [0.9%] patients on etodolac stopped treatment because of elevated liver enzymes [ALT, AST or Alk P] or bilirubin, compared to 0.4% of placebo- and 4% of aspirin-recipients.
260	Update on cases of liver injury reported to the Spanish Pharmacovigilance Database between 2003-2010 identified 20 cases of liver injury possibly due to Herbalife products; 16 in women, mean age 45 years, 12 hospitalized [bilirubin 0.6 to 33.3 mg/dL, ALT 88 to 3269 U/L, Alk P 112 to 1034 U/L]; one patient developed cirrhosis, the others recovered; 1 to 9 different Herbalife products were implicated and no single ingredient appeared common to most cases.
261	Review of side effects of methotrexate; table showing results of 25 patients with psoriasis who developed cirrhosis after 1-10 years of therapy [total dose 0.5-6.5 g], many of whom were able to continue methotrexate for another 1-8 years.
262	35 year old woman developed dark urine 2 days after smoking crack cocaine [bilirubin 3.0 mg/dL, ALT 9295 U/L, Alk P 131 U/L, CPK 258 U/L, creatinine 5.3 mg/dL], resolving over next two weeks.
263	"Among ""nearly"" 2,600 patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the ARAMIS database, abnormal ALT values were present in <5%, highest rates in those on salicylates [7.6%], sulindac [8.3%], methotrexate [9.5%] and lowest in those on hydroxychloroquine even in combination with methotrexate and salicylates."
264	72 year old woman developed abdominal pain 7 days after starting norfloxacin [peak bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL, ALT 310 U/L, Alk P 271 U/L], resolving within a few weeks upon stopping.
265	54 year old man with prostate cancer developed weakness after 6 months of flutamide therapy [bilirubin normal, ALT 4.2 times ULN, Alk P normal], levels returning to normal after stopping.
266	Letter in response to Wright [1988] questioning efficacy of monitoring liver tests in preventing severe outcomes of disulfiram hepatotoxicity and recommending prompt discontinuation at onset of any symptom of liver injury.
267	4 siblings with congenital ichthyosis taking high doses of vitamin A developed liver disease [bilirubin 0.4-1.4 mg/dL, ALT 13-54 U/L, Alk P 184-1069 U/L]; biopsies showed stellate cell hypertrophy and variable degrees of fibrosis.
268	72 year old woman developed jaundice 13 months after starting lovastatin [bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL, AST 177 U/L, Alk P 351 U/L], resolving within 4 weeks of stopping; but also exposed to cloxacillin 2 weeks before onset of jaundice.
269	49 year old man developed symptoms after 2 and jaundice after 4 days of ketoprofen therapy [bilirubin 3.6 mg/dL, ALT 82 U/L, Alk P 186 U/L], resolving within 5 weeks of stopping: Case 2.
270	3 elderly women developed jaundice [2-8x ULN] within 6-7 days of starting rifampin with normal ALT, Alk P 2-3 times ULN, resolution in 14-30 days; in one biopsy showed “centrolobular cholestasis”.
271	58 year old on OCCs for 19 years found to have 8 by 12 cm adenoma; stopped OCCs, but 2-3 years later had rising alpha-fetoprotein and biopsy showed hepatocellular carcinoma.
272	Among 8 prospectively followed patients with malignancies receiving IL-2 [100,000 IU/kg 3 times daily for 5 days], serum bilirubin levels rose from 0.5 to 4.7 mg/dL [3.4 mg direct], becoming abnormal by day 3 and peaking on days 6-8 with a similar pattern of cholylglycine levels and mild rises in ALT, AST and Alk P becoming abnormal by day 6, all values returning to normal within one month.
273	44 year old man with cirrhosis developed jaundice 38 days after starting disulfiram with progression to hepatic failure [bilirubin 34.4 mg/dL, ALT 2330 U/L, Alk P 305 U/L, prothrombin index 18%], undergoing successful liver transplant.
274	Among 26 patients with upper gut dysmotility treated with cisapride vs placebo, symptoms improved equally in both groups, although measured gastric emptying changed only with cisapride; side effects were not mentioned.
275	Review of efficacy and safety of griseofulvin and ketoconazole for superficial mycoses; rate of hepatotoxicity of ketoconazole ranges from 1:10,000 to 1:15,000, and is more common among women and in persons over 40 years of age; recommends routine monitoring of liver enzymes; in contrast, griseofulvin is “remarkably safe” and no deaths have been attributed directly to the drug.
276	The aim of this article is to trace some features of the historical development of phytochemistry. In the period from 1870 to 1920 pharmacy at universities attempted a new phase, the emancipation as an independent science. The article analyses the contributions to phytochemistry by the professors E. Schmidt (1845-1921), H. Thomas (1859-1931), H. Beckurts (1855-1929) and their research schools as well as those of K. Polstorff (1846-1911) and m. Scholtz (1861-1919). 
277	It was established that non-operated patients with duodenal ulcer and patients after organ-saving operations associated with vagotomy show an essential increase of insulin and cortisol secretion and reveal a strict dependence of hormonal secretion on the severity of the pathological process and time after operation. The increased cortisol/insulin ratio correlated with a reduction of the body mass of patients. 
278	In the therapy of hyperlipemia nicotinic acid derivates, cholestyramine, fibrate derivates and HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors are drugs of choice. The most important drugs of each group, the mode of action and the side effects are presented. In the therapy of hypercholesterolemia HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors alone or in special cases in combination with low dose of cholestyramine are best qualified. For the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and hypercholesterolemia fibrate derivates are recommended. 
279	A married couple with multiple myeloma (MM) is reported. Although we could not find any definite pathogenetic factors of MM in the spouses examined, the salient features of the 10 couples with MM reviewed, including ours, were summarized to obtain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of MM. The appearance of MM in spouses suggests that environmental factors are involved in the pathogenesis of MM. 
280	In the search for the cause of Parkinson's disease epidemiology serves several purposes. Valuable clues to the etiology may be derived from the epidemiological features of the disease, and the subsequent search for risk factors in analytical studies can be narrowed correspondingly. On the other hand, knowledge of the epidemiology of Parkinson's disease is necessary in creating etiological hypotheses, since only hypotheses consistent with the epidemiological profile deserve careful testing. 
281	The glycoregulation of 17 type II diabetics was observed to improve by administering 1 g of acetylsalicylic acid three times per day, during a one-year study. The subjects did not lose weight during the experimental period, but the insulin daily requirement of 7 patients did decrease by 60%. 
282	The different aspects of the etiopathogenesis of arterial hypertension in diabetes mellitus are reviewed. Therapeutic approaches and the several phases of treatment are discussed, with particular emphasis on the most recent developments. 
283	 Review of structure, pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of nitrofurantoin for urinary tract infections; nitrofurantoin is a nitrated furan 5-member ring with a hydantoin side chain, which is minimally metabolized by the liver and excreted rapidly in the urine.
284	Isolated superfused rat atria release [3H]-acetylcholine when depolarized with 57 mM potassium. The depolarization-induced [3H]-acetylcholine overflow was significantly reduced in atria from chronically T. cruzi-infected rats with electrocardiographically characterized cardiopathy. This fact suggests the occurrence of functional alterations of cardiac parasympathetic control in these animals, probably related to cardiac ganglion cell destruction. 
285	In a single-center, double-blind, randomized study, 19 patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease stage II Fontaine were treated with bencyclan, and a further 19 patients with buflomedil for 10 weeks after a wash-out phase of 2 weeks. Both groups showed a significant increase in painfree and total walking distances. No significant difference was found between the two groups. 
286	"The recognition of potentially noxious physiological substances in the intestinal milieu, prompted the use of an ""elemental"" semi-hydrolysed formula diet in the prophylaxis of experimental acute ischemic enteropathy. An elemental diet protects the intestinal mucosa of rodents from radiation injury and facilitates mucosal healing. Clinical trials have shown the benefits of this form of treatment in the prevention of acute radiation enteritis and therapy of delayed enteropathy and Crohn's disease. "
287	The A.A. emphasize the importance of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in oncologic treatment. The most significant aspects of psychiatric therapy were analyzed in a special group on oncologic diseases, such as breast cancer, malignant tumors of the limb bones and in the inactivity-desuse syndrome. It is concluded that rehabilitation treatment could be generalized to a larger group of oncologic situations. 
288	Drepanocytosis is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy which is particularly common in Blacks; in its homozygote form there is constant general involvement of the osteoarticular system with clearly recognisable clinical and radiographic pictures. Microdrepanocytosis (double heterozygotosis) is instead more difficult to recognise. Based on their observations the authors report several specific aspects of the disease of orthopaedic interest. 
289	Some forms of arthritis cause few symptoms and little or no disability, while others cause severe pain, deformity and loss of function, and may even be fatal. Management must vary accordingly between the simple and the complex, the latter necessitating the use of potentially toxic agents. This article highlights some therapeutic approaches and emphasises the factors that influence the decision making process. Some areas of difficulty are discussed, particularly the treatment of dyspepsia in chronic arthritis. 
290	The excision of malignant melanomas is accepted worldwide as a therapy of choice but there are controversies concerning resection margins, prophylactic lymph node dissection, isolated hyperthermic perfusion of extremities and adjuvant therapy in high-risk patients. The relevant literature is analyzed with regard to these aspects, and based on this analysis and our own experiences in more than 3,600 melanoma patients, recommendations for therapy of primary malignant melanomas and follow-up are given. 
291	Sanguinarine chloride, a quaternary salt of a benzophenanthrene alkaloid, was phototoxic to catalase-deficient strains of Escherichia coli but not to Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper moth larvae), an insect with high levels of catalase activity. Chemical analyses confirm that sanguinarine is an efficient producer of H2O2. This differential toxicity suggests that the mode of phototoxic action involves production of H2O2 which could be detoxified in many organisms by catalase. 
292	Administration of either prednisolone or dexamethasone (10 mg/kg body wt/day/oral) to rats for 21 days resulted in inhibition of (pro)insulin biosynthesis and immunoreactive insulin release by isolated islets. A gradual reversal of prednisolone's effect was obtained after exposing islets to increasing glucose concentrations but glucose challenges failed to influence dexamethasone's effect. 
293	The paper describes a case of an 85-year-old woman affected by psoriasis for 30 years who developed bullous pemphigoid after UVB treatment. Immunological and histological findings were typical of bullous pemphigoid cell-poor type. Bullous eruptions cleared following combined therapy with betamethasone and azathioprine. The literature on the subject and pathogenetic hypotheses for this unusual association are discussed. 
294	The biological causes of edentulous alveolar crest reabsorption are examined in the light of recent discoveries on the physiopathology of bone metabolism. The main techniques used for the classification of patients in terms of bone metabolism type are then described and the question of whether any currently available pharmacological treatment is capable of preparing for, supporting, preserving or even effectively replacing preprosthetic surgery is posed. 
295	Acute, non-traumatic paraplegia is a very rare condition in childhood. Because of this the correct diagnosis is not recognized in time. We want to call attention to this illness by reporting on four patients we treated between the years 1984 and 1986. We put together and analyzed the literature on this disorder for the first time, and established guide lines-first, to recognize those causes of the disorder which by all means have to be treated in time, and second, how to proceed further diagnostically. 
296	About 300 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) underwent multimodality treatment including laser radiation of varying wavelengths. Use was made of helium-neon, infrared, argon and helium-cadmium lasers. A new method of combined laser therapy by radiation of helium-cadmium and helium-neon lasers is described. A scheme of optimal parameters and types of laser radiation recommended for the treatment of different clinical varieties of RA is provided. 
297	The influence of human recombinant alpha-interferon (reaferon) on cell-mediated and humoral immune response has been studied. Experimental facts on the blast transformation of lymphocytes, humoral immune response and the reaction of delayed hypersensitivity are presented. The study has shown that reaferon possesses the main immunoregulatory properties, characteristic of natural human leukocytic alpha-interferon. Manifestation of these properties depends on the dose of preparation and the time of its use. 
298	The current literature and the authors data on the clinics and morphology of the extrahepatic (visceral) pathology provoked by the hepatitis virus are analysed. 
299	The subject presented for its rarity is a case of rhabdomyosarcoma embryonal ear in girl patient 6 years old. Her clinic first gave a wrong diagnosis of chronic otitis of the middle ear with otorrhea and facial paralysis. A malignant tumour was suspected during the operation. A histopathology study confirmed the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. A review of the literature is made and details given of how often it occurs, and incidence, histopathology types, treatment and prognosis. 
300	"A diagnosis of congenital heart disease was carried out in the 5.2/1,000 of 53,578 live neonates who were born in the Hospital ""Nuestra SeĂ±ora de Covadonga"" from 1-1-1976 to 12-31-1985. A relatively high and low incidences of ventricular and atrial septal defects were respectively found. The 69.1% of heart diseases were identified in the first month of life. "
301	Acute pancreatitis is a serious clinical problem. Many of the etiopathogenic mechanisms are not clear and its pathophysiology is very complex, with multisystemic implications. The outcome may be severe, and there is no general agreement on the therapeutic approach. In the present paper we review the newest etiopathogenic and physiopathologic concepts on acute pancreatitis as well as the diagnostic criteria on this condition. 
302	From November 1988 to March 1989, 804 Malagasy children stools were studied and 37 Shigella strains isolated. 5 Shigella dysenteriae type 1 from Malagasy East coast (Mananjary), presented a multiply resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, sulphonamides and trimethoprim. This last resistance has recently appeared in this area. 
303	The effect of vaginal placement of insulin was ascertained in rats by measuring plasma glucose levels. A rapid and sustained decrease of plasma glucose levels at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after vaginal insulin administration was observed, returning to basal levels by 240 minutes. Thus, rapid insulin absorption was not curtailed by vaginal mucose. The effect was independent of the rat oestrous cycle phase. 
304	The authors report a case of chronic splenic tuberculosis. They underline the diagnostic difficulties, notwithstanding the remarkable progresses in radiological technics, essentially related to the rarity of this tubercular site and they outlined the exact surgical indication to the splenectomy. 
305	The present study gives the first evidence, through immunofluorescence, of the prostaglandins PGE2 in radicular cysts. The results are in agreement with literature. In addition, the immunofluorescence technique has also demonstrated the localization of prostaglandins inside the cyst cavity. In opposition to previous data, the present study also shows that epithelial cells seem to synthesize more PGE2 than fibroblasts and mononuclear components of the external connective tissue. 
306	Bone marrow injury after exposure to ionizing radiation and cyclophosphamide was evaluated by morphologic analysis and by the ratio erythrocytes/nucleated cells (NN/N). The authors show the efficiency of the method proposed, which can be determined in bone marrow samples of variable and unpredictable size. 
307	Eighteen patients with subcortical lobar hematomas were reviewed. Arterial hypertension was the leading cause and three had arteriovenous malformation and were treated surgically. More than half of cases had hematomas of either the temporooccipital or occipital lobes. Common neurologic findings were headaches, vomiting, alertness, dysarthria, hemiparesis and hemianopsia. All patients survived and had better resolution of neurological deficits, suggesting that surgical intervention is not necessary. 
308	8 year old was found to have hepatomegaly 12 months after starting propylthiouracil [bilirubin normal, ALT 765 U/L, GGT 3 times ULN], biopsy showing chronic hepatitis; ANA negative but antithyroid antibodies present; rapid resolution on stopping drug and later tolerating methimazole.
309	57 year old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and polymyositis developed AST and Alk P elevations 3 weeks after starting azathioprine, resolving with stopping and recurring with rechallenge, biopsies showed minimal nonspecific changes.
310	Brief summary of experience using amiodarone in 426 patients followed for 2 months to 13 years; 10% developed liver test abnormalities, but were largely mild and self limiting, none resulting in clinical hepatitis or cirrhosis.
311	47 year old woman developed liver test abnormalities and ascites having taken comfrey pills and tea daily for more than a year [bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL, ALT 24 U/L, Alk P 27 U/L], biopsy showing chronic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.
312	73 year old man developed pruritus and abdominal discomfort 9 months after starting atenolol [bilirubin 2.9 mg/dL, ALT 320 U/L, Alk P 100 U/L] which persisted for 6 months until atenolol was stopped, values then becoming normal within 4 weeks.
313	Retrospective analysis of 364 liver biopsies from 168 patients with psoriasis treated with methotrexate for 0 to 19 years [mean=4 years]; among 83 biopsies before therapy, 80% were normal, 20% had fibrosis, none cirrhosis [those with cirrhosis were not treated]; during treatment, fibrosis scores increased but rarely by much and most improved with subsequent withdrawal of therapy.
314	20 cases of death from suspected isoniazid hepatitis identified between 1973 and 1986 in California, 19 given isoniazid for latent and 1 for active tuberculosis, ages 5-73 years, 16 [80%] in women, no other clear risk factors, most not regularly monitored, 4 had delay in stopping isoniazid; peak ALT 469-2580 U/L, bilirubin 6.4-47 mg/dL.
315	75 year old woman developed fever and hepatomegaly 7 months after starting amiodarone therapy [800 mg/day] [bilirubin not given, AST 140 U/L, Alk P 850 U/L]; despite reduction in dose, she developed cirrhosis over the next 20 months: initial biopsy showed micro- and macrovesicular fat and ballooning; later biopsy showed cirrhosis, inflammation, granular cells and Mallory bodies but no steatosis.
316	10 cows suffering from bacteriological proved A. pyogenes-endometritis have been treated by a single intrauterine infusion of GENTASEPTIN. All animals were cured. Clinical findings were confirmed by bacteriological tests. All animals conceived at the first insemination after treatment. The intrauterine application of GENTASEPTIN seems to be a very efficient treatment of A. pyogenes-endometritis as compared to hitherto existing treatments. 
317	Substantial gains have been made in both patient and graft survival during 20 years of transplanting kidneys at the University of Florida. The number of transplant recipients yearly has increased from six in 1966 to more than 100 in 1986. The use of immunosuppression reflects our evolving understanding of transplant immunology, with current morbidity and mortality rates considerably improved over those of the early years. This paper summarizes our transplantation experience over the past two decades. 
318	We have reported a case of primary cutaneous zygomycosis in a diabetic patient receiving continuous insulin infusion pump therapy. We believe this to be the first reported case of a fungal infection associated with the use of an insulin pump. The infection itself was an unusually mild and chronic zygomycosis, possibly due to a low production rate of proteolytic enzymes by a rare opportunistic human pathogen, Rhizomucor pusillus. 
319	We describe a 44 year old male with severe enterocolitis as the dominating symptom of idiopatic hypereosinophilic syndrome. The clinical picture was dominated by incapacitating diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. A significant rise of eosinophils was found in peripheral blood. The patient was treated successfully using a combined regimen with hydroxyurea/steroids. We outline diagnosis, differential diagnosis and guidelines for treatment. 
320	Determination of postmortem interval according to the time course of cathepsins activity within 5 days since death was carried out using myocardium and skeletal muscles of white breedless rats and cadavers of people who died of craniocerebral trauma. Natural time course of changes in cathepsins activity was determined which makes it possible to use these values as one of criteria in determination of postmortem interval. 
321	Acute abdominal pain occurs frequently in patients with sickle cell anaemia (SCA), and presents a difficult diagnostic and management problem as the clinical presentation may mimic an acute surgical condition. Good clinical judgement and careful observation are necessary to avoid increased morbidity and mortality. Chronic recurrent upper abdominal pain is also a common problem and in many the cause is unknown. These patients usually respond to simple symptomatic therapy. 
322	Immunization of Wistar rats with tularemic vaccine has been studied for its influence on the cytogenetic effect of adryblastine and pharmorubicyn. It is shown that the number of aberrant metaphases considerably decreases in the myelocaryocytes of vaccinated rats. Antimutagenic effect is induced by the influence of tularemic vaccine on the metabolic activation processes of antibiotics and, possibly, by an increase of the activity of antioxidative enzymes in the rat organism. 
323	Administration of protamine sulfate into circulation was shown to increase the diabetogenic effect of alloxan. Protamine sulfate bound endogenous heparin, as a result of which the diabetogenic factor caused more severe forms of experimental diabetes. At the same time, the diabetogenic factor exhibited distinctly higher activity during the heparin deficiency developed. 
324	Aminocaproic acid is a widely used antifibrinolytic agent. Serious adverse effects associated with its use are rare, but we report on a patient with liver disease and cirrhosis who experienced a grand mal seizure during the intravenous administration of aminocaproic acid. Clinicians should be alert to the occurrence of this adverse effect in patients with no previous neurological problems. 
325	The clinical effects of tofisopam were studied on 29 patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. Tofisopam was administered at a dose of 50 mg three times a day for more than 2 weeks. The clinical effects of tofisopam were revealed to be 79% in all patients. Only one patient (3%) complained of thirst. These results suggest that tofisopam is an effective drug to treat lower urinary tract symptoms. 
326	"This report is of a patient treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis who developed peritonitis attributed to a Rhodococcus species. The rhodococci are rarely pathogenic to humans, and there are no previous reports of peritonitis associated with these organisms. It is important for clinicians to be aware of these bacteria because they can be acid-fast and can be confused with mycobacteria. They are often reported as ""diphtheroids"" but should not be considered contaminants. "
327	The use of considerable amounts of gelatinol in hypothermal perfusion determined the occurrence of marked hypercalcemia. The hormonal mechanism (parathyroid hormone and calcitonin) responsible for hypercalcemia compensation proved to be inefficient under hypothermal perfusion. A forced diuresis failed to result in rapid normalization of blood calcium concentrations. The volume of gelatinol used during extracorporeal circulation is not to exceed 500 ml. 
328	Serum concentrations of interferon alfa, interleukin 1, and tumour necrosis factor alpha were measured in 25 untreated patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A close correlation was found between serum concentrations of interferon alfa and the degree of fever, while no significant correlations were found between fever and interleukin 1 or tumour necrosis factor alpha. These results suggest the possible involvement of interferon alfa in the pathogenesis of fever in SLE. 
329	Two fatal cases are represented in which the intake of the tricyclic neuroleptic drug with the active ingredient clozapine was involved. The chemical toxiological results are showed and in connection with the results of the autopsies and the case history discussed. 
330	A sialoglycoprotein was isolated by affinity chromatography on immobilized transcortin from plasma membranes of human decidual endometrium cells, whose components were labeled with 125I and solubilized with sodium cholate. The apparent molecular mass of the monomer is 20.0 +/- 1.5 kDa, pI is at pH 3.3. The sialoglycoprotein specifically binds transcortin complexed to progesterone with Kd approximately 10(-10) M. 
331	Malignant fibrous histiocytoma arising in bone infarcts has only been recently recognized as a pathologic entity. Eighteen cases have been reported prior to this one. A case of a malignant fibrous histiocytoma developing in a 58-year-old man with idiopathic medullary bone infarcts in the distal femurs is presented along with a review of the literature. 
332	Nourseothricin, a mixture of several streptothricins, is inactivated by an acetyl transferase produced by Escherichia coli containing the plasmid pIE636. Nourseothricin inactivated in the presence of 14C-acetate was purified and submitted to partial hydrolysis. In the hydrolysate besides others a radioactive and ninhydrin-reactive substance moving only slightly towards the cathode was found. It proved to be [14C]-acetyl beta-lysine. 
333	Small cell anaplastic carcinoma (SCAC) is usually treated non-surgically and, therefore, diagnosis is best done by the least invasive means. Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy is very accurate in diagnosing malignancy and reasonably accurate in diagnosing malignant cell type. An unequivocal cytological diagnosis of SCAC has a positive predictive value of 0.90 at our institution. The accuracy is lowered by uncertain or suggestive cytological diagnoses. 
334	A 62-year-old man died from hemoperitoneum secondary to nontraumatic hepatic rupture. At autopsy, the liver was massively enlarged by undiagnosed metastatic small cell carcinoma of the lung. The site of exsanguination was distended by tumor, culminating in sudden bursting of the hepatic capsule. Nontraumatic rupture may result from a variety of neoplastic and nonneoplastic diseases. Hemoperitoneum secondary to lung carcinoma is rare, and even more so is the association with sudden unexpected death. 
335	Treatment of adult mice with gold sodium thiomalate made the normally non-lethal Semliki Forest virus and Sindbis virus infections lethal and increased the virulence of Langat and West Nile viruses. These changes were associated with an enhanced virus invasion of the brain. Depression of the humoral antibody response was not observed. 
336	6 month old infant with Reyes-like syndrome [ALT 9690 U/L] had low carnitine levels that increased with recovery; testing 13 asymptomatic children on valproate found low levels ~40 ?M compared to 50 ?M in controls.
337	Seven cases of jaundice attributed to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine [Fansidar] prophylaxis against malaria; cases arose after 2-12 weeks of therapy, were usually hepatocellular and 6 were jaundiced [bilirubin 0.7-15.2 mg/dL, Alk P 1-2 times normal, ALT 20-90 times normal], resolving within 4-12 weeks of stopping.
338	25 year old developed fever and rash 7 days after starting sulfasalazine with atypical lymphocytosis, but negative EBV testing [bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, ALT 1035 U/L, Alk P 250 U/L].
339	"Review of chemistry, pharmacology, mechanism of action, efficacy and safety of terazosin; among 1006 patients taking terazosin in clinical studies, 14% withdrew because of side effects but none due to liver injury, and laboratory indices ""were not significantly altered by terazosin""."
340	"5 of 40 children with Wilms tumor receiving pulsed, intensive regimens of dactinomycin developed ""sharp rises in liver function test values"", hepatomegaly and ascites; one died and the others recovered fully."
341	Case series of 5 patients who developed abnormal liver tests 6 to 45 months after starting busulfan and thioguanine for chronic myelocytic leukemia with varices found after 16 to 98 months, biopsies showing nodular regeneration: Case 2.
342	"Prospective ultrasound study of 37 children receiving ceftriaxone; 16 [43%] developed sludge and 1 urolithiasis in 4 to 22 days, 3 [8%] symptomatic, all resolved in 2-63 days; referred to syndrome as ""biliary pseudolithiasis""."
343	56 year old man and 37 year old woman developed acute liver failure after ingestion of bottle of Nyquil [420 mL: 14 g acetaminophen in 25% alcohol] over 1-3 days [bilirubin 1.3 and 12.5 mg/dL, AST 8285 and 2413 U/L, Alk P 249 and 53 U/L], both survived.
344	Analysis of side effects in 272 patients with cancer treated with trimetrexate suggested that leukopenia and mucositis were dose related and that patients with low baseline serum protein levels were more likely to suffer severe side effects; ALT or AST elevations above 5 times ULN occurring in 22% of subjects with serum albumin 3.2 g/dL or below, but only 5-9% with normal values.
345	In recent years, because of advances in diagnostic techniques and therapy for malignant tumors, it is not rare to encounter cases of primary multiple malignant neoplasms. However, triple cancer is still rare. We report a case of triple cancer--gastric cancer, sigmoid colon cancer and malignant fibrous histiocytoma. To our regret, we could not make a diagnosis while the patient was alive. Careful examination of a cancer patient is important because malignant tumors may develop at any time. 
346	The splenic index was determined in 155 persons, without evidence of splenic disease, in order to obtain a simple measure of splenic size. Subsequently 36 patients with malignant lymphomas and who then had their spleens removed were examined by CT. A comparison of the CT and pathological-anatomical findings showed that it is a valuable non-invasive method for diagnosing splenic involvement, having a specificity of 86%, sensitivity of 77% and accuracy of 83%. 
347	Data borrowed from the All-Union Cancer Register on 42 small cell lung cancer survivors over 2.5 years are presented. The average age of patients was 56 years; the male/female ratio was 6:1. Seventeen patients survived over 5 years. 
348	Hepatocellular carcinoma is generally associated with long-standing chronic liver disease of diverse etiology, most commonly HBsAg-positive chronic active hepatitis, hemochromatosis, or alcoholic liver disease. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis have only rarely developed a subsequent hepatocellular carcinoma. We report such a patient, a 77-year-old woman with an early, precirrhotic stage of primary biliary cirrhosis who developed a hepatoma. 
349	Although carcinoma of the lung metastatic to the pancreas is not unusual in autopsy series, it is rare as a cause of extra-hepatic bile duct obstruction among the living. We have reported two cases of oat cell carcinoma of the lung in which the first sign of metastatic disease was extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. Ultrasonography provides a quick, direct, and noninvasive means of evaluating such obstruction, allowing early diagnosis and surgical palliation. 
350	We report a case of epidermotropic high-grade malignant lymphoma associated with hypercalcemia occurring in a European woman aged 30 years. The clinical, histological, and biological presentation of the patient could enter the spectrum of HOTS (hypercalcemia, osteolysis, T cell lymphoma syndrome). The proliferation of neoplastic lymphocytes was very high in patch, plaques, and nodules of the skin. 
351	Thirteen confirmed cases of toxic shock syndrome temporally related to use of the vaginal contraceptive sponge have been reported. The observed risk of toxic shock syndrome in sponge users may be elevated above estimated background rates, but this risk remains very low. Traumatic manipulation of the sponge, use during menstruation or the puerperium, and prolonged retention of the sponge may additionally increase toxic shock syndrome risk. As with all contraceptives, risks must be balanced against benefits. 
352	Chemoendocrine therapy was performed on a man with advanced breast cancer, and partial response was observed for 11 months. Estrogen receptor in cancer tissue was detected before and after the therapy. Progesterone receptor, however, was not detected after the treatment, whether it had been there or not prior to it. The serum estrone level was continuously high during the treatment, but the serum testosterone level was obviously decreased after that. 
353	Altogether 84 children aged 1 to 15 were examined. The index of 99mTc-pertechnetate relative accumulation in the ectopic gastric mucosa was proposed to be used to objectify and improve the quality of diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum. The index over 42% was shown to be typical of Meckel's diverticulum and it can be used for automated diagnosis of the disease. The use of the above quantitative index made it possible to reject 20% of false positive results obtained at visual interpretation of scintigrams. 
354	A dynamic complex evaluation of immunologic vigor was carried out in 17 cases of Kaposi's sarcoma. Immunologic disorders were found to be in a correlation with clinical course. Three groups were identified: (1) patients with favourable prognosis (OKT4+/OKT8+ ratio--1.46 +/- 0.09), (12) slowly advancing disease (OKT4+/OKT8+ ratio--0.87 +/- 0.13) and (3) unfavorable clinical course (OKT4+/OKT8+ ratio--0.47 +/- 0.04). The said variations are comparable to those of cyclic nucleotide level in blood lymphocytes. 
355	Using a specific radioimmunoassay technique it seems that Prostacyclin (PG-I2) has a strong effect on the cyclic nucleotide content of the rat gastric (fundic) mucosa. 1 min after an intragastric application of 100 micrograms/kg PG-I2 the cAMP-content and in the 5th min the cGMP-content showed a highly significant decrease. It seems that the basic mechanism of action of PG-I2 is a typical 'hit and run' effect, acting on the intracellular 'second messenger system'. 
356	A child with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) and severe anemia caused by bleeding from diffuse intestinal hemangiomatosis is presented. Hemangiomas of the bowel should be considered in any child with unexplained anemia and coexisting cutaneous hemangiomas. The diagnostic workup of patients with KTS and symptomatic hemangiomatosis is outlined with respect to indications for surgical management. 
357	A case of primary oxalosis Type I with characteristic intraocular calcium-oxalate deposition is reported. Both affected eyes show typical pathologic manifestations, which are intensified by a cytomegalic infection caused by cortisone therapy. 
358	"The presence of viral antigens was detected by the indirect immunofluorescence technique in exfoliated cells occurring in the pharyngeal exudate of 18 out of 29 patients with peripheral facial paralysis. The most frequently encountered antigens were: Coxsackie A and B virus (33.3%), adenovirus (16.7%), and the association Coxsackie B virus + adenovirus (16.7%). The possibility that some of the so-called ""idiopathic"" peripheral facial paralyses may have a viral etiology is discussed. "
359	Concentration of transferrin was distinctly increased in the infarction zone of heart muscle of rabbits with experimental myocardium infarction within 24 hrs and 168 hrs after coronary occlusion. Under conditions of cell lysis apotransferrin appears to bind free iron in rabbit heart muscle. The data obtained suggest that apotransferrin may serve as a screening agent of free iron, while caeruloplasmin is able to exhibit the superoxide dismutase activity. 
360	An improved understanding of the patho-physiological and biochemical changes that occur in shock states has led to new and innovative pharmacologic approaches to shock reversal. In this article, we review the actions of several pharmaceutical agents on the peripheral vasculature in shock states. Agents with known efficacy, probable utility, and possible usefulness are each discussed. A model of factors modulating alpha-1 adrenergic receptor action is presented. 
361	The fermentation and isolation of a new, non-peptide cholecystokinin antagonist, asperlicin, produced by Aspergillus alliaceus is described. The potent and specific interaction of asperlicin with cholecystokinin receptors was shown using in vitro biochemical assays. 
362	Multiple beadlike fibromas have been observed in the lungs of European elks bearing cutaneous fibromas and fibropapillomas. DNA extracted from the lung fibromas was found to contain multiple copies of unintegrated European elk papillomavirus DNA, indicating an association between pulmonary fibromatosis and papillomavirus. No virus particles were observed in the tumor tissue by electron microscopy. Histological examination revealed that the lung fibromas had a morphology similar to that of cutaneous fibromas. 
363	By means of combined lectinological and immunological methods were demonstrated mistletoe lectin I binding sites on rat cerebral cortex synaptosomes. The mistletoe lectin I binds specifically D-galactose. Galactosyl residues were established on the junctional and nonjunctional synaptosomal membrane, on the synaptic vesicles, mitochondria and on myelin contamination. The relative number of mistletoe lectin I receptors per unit area of synaptosomal membrane was calculated. 
364	A 21-year-old man with acute retinal necrosis showed a marked increase in the convalescent titer to herpes simplex type 1 virus, especially in the aqueous humor obtained by anterior chamber paracentesis. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we tried to detect the herpesvirus antigen in the circulating immune complex obtained from this patient. The immune complex contained an antigen or antigens that reacted with antiherpes simplex type 1 antibody. 
365	52 year old woman developed asymptomatic elevations in ALT [11 rising to 95 U/L] and Alk P [95 to 268 U/L] without jaundice 10 days after starting indomethacin, resolving rapidly upon stopping.
366	Analysis of 75 trials of 33 drugs used to treat intermittent claudication in the English literature [1965-1985] found design problems in 76% of trials and concluded that available information does not support the efficacy of any agent in improving exercise performance in intermittent claudication.
367	Cost effectiveness analysis of 12 vs 24 vs 52 weeks of isoniazid for latent tuberculosis; assumptions being that 3.6, 12.4 and 14.3 case per 1000 persons would be prevented and frequency of hepatitis would be 0.3 vs 0.5 vs 0.6%; 12 month course was most cost effective.
368	Valproic acid administration in pregnancy may be a potential teratogen to the developing fetus. Numerous animal studies have linked valproic acid to vertebral anomalies and renal agenesis. Recent European data have suggested valproic acid as a causal agent of neural tube defects in human offspring. Research relative to teratogenicity of valproic acid administration for petit mal epilepsy is reviewed. Conclusions indicate that the benefits of valproic acid administration outweigh the hazards of teratogenicity. 
369	Using microspectrofluorimetry, we have studied some spectral modifications induced by the accumulation of fluorescent metabolites from some PAH in single living cells (3T3 and RTG2 fibroblasts). Whatever the parent compound under study, no spectral deformation has been detected in the 3T3 cells. On the contrary, the characteristic fluorescence spectra were strongly modified in RTG2 cells when the parent compound was either B(a)P or CPAP. The B(a)P metabolites have been identified as 3-OH-B(a)P and 9-OH-B(a)P. 
370	Two-hundred foot venograms were performed in patients suspected of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Eighty studies were positive for DVT in the calf, popliteal, superficial femoral, or common femoral veins. Of these, 16 (20%) had an associated venous thrombosis in the foot. One hundred and ten studies were negative. Of these, none had a positive foot venogram. It is therefore our feeling that an additional study of the foot need not be performed unless there are symptoms specifically referable to this area. 
371	Experiments were performed on rabbits 30 min, 6 hours, 1, 3, 7, 15 and 30 days after intravenous injection of thiophosphamide in a dose of 6 mg/kg body weight. The drug produced considerable changes in the activity of blood serum ceruloplasmin and blood copper content. The pattern of the changes in the enzyme activity and copper content depends on the time elapsed after the drug injection. 
372	The addition of 5 days of rifampin therapy to a 10- or 14-day course of penicillin or erythromycin therapy has been shown to reduce greatly the rate of chronic streptococcal carriage. The empiric use of rifampin in combination with penicillin or erythromycin in nine of nine patients with streptococcal-associated psoriasis appeared to coincide with a marked improvement in their skin. 
373	A method is described for the direct analysis of the amino acid carbocisteine in plasma and urine samples, following reaction with dabsyl chloride. Dabsylated carbocisteine is subjected to high pressure liquid chromatography with spectrophotometric detection at 425 nm. The usefulness of the method for bioavailability studies is discussed and compared with methods currently in use. 
374	"The growth of international tourism has increased the risk of diseases imported from abroad. Travel in developing countries involves a not inconsiderable risk, particularly of contracting hepatitis A. The risk of B or non A non B hepatitis is less marked, but the prognostic significance is more serious. The incidence, diagnosis and significance of the various types of ""traveller's hepatitis"", and the possibility of prevention, are discussed. "
375	As organ transplantation has become increasingly effective, difficult questions have been raised about its costs. Cost-effectiveness analysis is one approach that permits relatively straightforward comparisons not only among transplant procedures but among other costly lifesaving therapies. When compared with other such procedures, most organ transplants are found to be cost effective. 
376	Review of all the reports of fatal liver injury from valproate reported to drug company and FDA between 1978 and 1984 found 37 cases; highest number in children <2 years, with coincidental neurologic problems and polytherapy with other anticonvulsants; onset usually within first 90 days; variable presentations and laboratory abnormalities.
377	The Tsk mouse has a genetically transmitted connective tissue disease whose skin lesions resemble those of scleroderma. After treatment with disodium cromoglycate, a marked decrease in skin fibrosis was observed, raising the possibility that disodium cromoglycate may be a potential treatment for human scleroderma. 
378	We describe an unusual case of pruritus after intravesical thiotepa, and diaphoresis, shortness of breath, chills and pruritus following intravesical doxorubicin therapy. Such generalized allergic reactions occur uncommonly after bladder instillation of thiotepa or doxorubicin. 
379	In 5 female patients suffering from focal epilepsies, the maximal velocity of saccades was determined before and during carbamazepinE therapy. A decrease in the velocity of saccades was followed by an increase at the same serum level. 
380	Fatty liver in animals is commonly associated with toxic or nutritional disease. In tropical Africa, fatty liver in poultry is of considerable economic importance. However, it's occurrence and association with renal damage have not yet been reported. We now report the effects of hemorrhagic and fatty hepatorenal syndrome in Hybro breeding hens naturally exposed to heat stress and fed low level of aflatoxin B1. 
381	Naturally produced interferon-gamma was evaluated in 187 cases with advanced cancer. Interferon was given by the i.v. routes in doses ranging from 1 X 10(5) IU to 2 X 10(5) IU/day daily or every other day for more than 2 months. Overall, clinical anticancer spectrum, effectiveness, toxicities, and pharmacokinetics were similar to that seen with preparations of interferon-alpha, and beta.

482	The incidence of prospective organ donors in the United States and the techniques which are to used to guarantee their optimal use after identification are analyzed. Attitudes of the public and health professionals toward organ donation are discussed. The organization of the Pittsburgh Organ Procurement Agency and its relationship to other such agencies is described. Finally, the presently used techniques of liver salvaging and preservation are outlined.

485	In a 3 year old girl with MTHFR deficiency, betaine therapy [6-20 g daily] resulted in a decrease of homocysteine levels to trace amounts and a partial improvement in clinical symptoms “without apparent harmful effects and without signs of a disturbed liver function”.
486	"In a crossover study conducted over a six-month period in eight patients with well-characterized premenstrual syndrome, physical and behavioral symptoms were relieved by daily administration of an agonist of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. The reversible ""medical ovariectomy"" attained with this agonist suggests that it may be an effective and rational treatment for this distressing syndrome in the short term. Whether prolonged therapy would be safe and effective, or even necessary, remains to be determined."
487	Extensive review of mechanism of action, efficacy and safety of propylthiouracil and methimazole in treating hyperthyroidism; side effects occur in 1-5% of patients, including fever, rash, urticaria, transient leucopenia, and arthralgias particularly with higher doses; severe side effects include agranulocytosis, vasculitis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia and nephritic syndrome.

494	Multicomponent self-diffusion studies provide a general picture of amphiphile self-association. Both micelles and microemulsions based on bile salts show a lower degree of association cooperativity, lower aggregate charge densities and more extensive hydration than corresponding ionic surfactant systems. Effectively bicontinuous isotropic solutions of the microemulsion type are more easily formed by bile salts than by surfactants.
495	The purpose of this paper is to review the past and current in vitro studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms of cholesterol gallstone dissolution in bile. As is pointed out, there has been considerable progress in this area during the past 15 years with regard to the physical chemistry of the dissolution process.

499	Letter in response to Avner [1983] suggesting that sinusoidal obstruction syndrome may be a part of the clinical spectrum of cystinosis, rather than a complication of cysteamine therapy.
500	Two cases and review of literature on Reye syndrome in children on long term aspirin for rheumatologic disorders; 3 and 1 year olds on 80 and 150 mg/kg/day of aspirin for 3 months developed fever and then vomiting and coma with AST 1532 and 3460 U/L, bilirubin 0.7 and 1.0 mg/dL and high ammonia, lactate and protime, both recovered but one left with spastic quadriparesis.
501	1 year old boy developed ALT elevations one month after ethosuximide was added to a chronic regimen of valproate and phenobarbital that continued to worsen after stopping valproate [bilirubin normal, ALT 69 rising 229 U/L, GGT 175 U/], and resolved rapidly when ethosuximide was stopped.
502	Two cases; 28 year old woman developed jaundice 5 months after starting propylthiouracil [bilirubin 7.2 mg/dL, AST 250 U/L, Alk P normal], resolving in 2 months and recurring upon rechallenge, but then tolerating methimazole; 54 year old woman developed jaundice and pruritus 5 months after restarting propylthiouracil [bilirubin 2.4 mg/dL, AST 60 U/L, Alk P 220 U/L], with slow, incomplete recovery on stopping and biopsy later showing cirrhosis.

504	Among 26 children with ALL treated with 43 courses of pentostatin [0.25-1.0 mg/kg/day for 3 days], dose-limiting toxicities were neurologic [seizures, coma], pulmonary, renal and hepatic, including 2 patients receiving high doses who developed severe injury: one had jaundice and fever the day after completing the first course [bilirubin not given, ALT 743 U/L] and died of respiratory failure one day later; a second developed jaundice, fever and ascites after 2 days of therapy [bilirubin 15.4 mg/dL, ALT normal] and died two weeks later; autopsy in both patients failed to demonstrate a clear cause.
505	Among 99 children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis treated with aspirin or fenoprofen for 12 weeks, pain control was similar, but side effects were more with aspirin, ALT elevations arising in 5 children on aspirin [4 required discontinuation], but none on fenoprofen.
506	Absorption of ATG using fetal liver cells was effective in removing cytotoxicity to hematopoietic stem cells, but did not affect the immunosuppressive activity [which is directed primarily against mature T cells] of the antibody preparation.
507	The today situation of the Italian physician in the fight against drug addictions is outlined. Since the medical approach to this problem is not exhaustive, and on the basis of biological aspects more clinical-therapeutic knowledge of the withdrawal syndrome is required. 
508	"4 patients affected by hyperthyroidism presenting a feature of ""false acute abdomen"" as main clinical sign are presented. The low incidence of that association, according to the literature, and the difficulties of a correct diagnosis, which could lead to a useless laparotomy is pointed out. The conclusion is drawn that tests of thyroid functions should be done whenever the feature of acute abdomen presents without any past history of gastro-enteric lesions. "
509	Bladder instillation of cytosine arabinoside (CA), 400 mg in 20 ml sterilized distilled water, was performed in 30 cases of bladder tumors. The instillation was done everyday to inpatients or 3 times a week to outpatients, for a total of 20 procedures. The total effective rate was 33%. Although the effectiveness of CA bladder instillation was less than that of mitomycin C and adriamycin, the combination of CA and these drugs might be advisable. Neither general nor local side effect was observed. 
510	The investigation of the composition and properties of blood in 20 children with small intestine fistulas has revealed hypovolemia, disorders in the electrolyte composition, increased hematocrit and viscosity, changes of tests of coagulogram and thromboelastogram pointing to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Similar changes were noted in experimental studies in 20 dogs with duodenal fistulas. Drugs improving rheological properties of blood and anticoagulants gave better results of the treatment. 
511	20 year old woman developed fatigue and jaundice 2 weeks after starting propylthiouracil [bilirubin 22 mg/dL, AST 750 U/L, Alk P 248 U/L], with progressive hepatic failure, dying 4 months later.
512	The Authors studied the effects induced by long administration of hypothalamic phospholipids on the rat liver. They showed that the most important histologic changes can be observed in the liver of animals who received the longest treatment. Such changes consist of significant infiltration of lymphocytes and red blood cells that have overflowed into the pericentrolobular space. This picture of a not-too-serious blood stasis could justify the alterations of the epatocytes contemporarily observed. 
513	A case of probable exacerbation of an undiagnosed diabetic uropathy by a tricyclic antidepressant in a 67-year-old man with hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and recurrent major depressive disorder is reported. The presumed mode of interaction is discussed and pertinent literature reviewed. It is emphasized that the clinician must be alert to the possibility of psychotropic drugs producing physiologic changes that can interact with or aggravate preexisting disorders. 
514	Albumin metabolism was studied with the aid of 131 I- albumin in human blood serum in 5 healthy individuals and 40 patients with chronic cardiac insufficiency. It is shown that in patients with different degrees of circulatory insufficiency the loss of albumin with feces into gastro-intestinal lumen does not exceed the loss in the healthy individuals. The cardiac insufficiency is characterized by intracellular metabolic disorders of albumin of the hypercatabolic type. 
515	Tfhe regional distribution of cathepsin D activity was measured in 10 regiongs of rat brain. The greatest activity was found in the hypothalamo-pituitary axis and in regions surrounding the 4th ventricle. In rats injected centrally with the specific cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin, the protease activity was inhibited up to 90% in most brain regions. 
516	"""Spontaneous"" rupture of the oesophagus is rare and happens after a marked rapid rise in intraluminal oesophageal pressure (massive vomiting, asthma etc.). As is known from the literature, forceful swallowing alone may produce spontaneous perforation in the case of damage to the mucosa or muscular layer of the oesophagus. Boerhaave's syndrome associated with rare diffuse idiopathic muscular hypertrophy of the lower oesophagus has been described in only three cases in the literature. "
517	A case of cardiotoxicity caused by 5-fluoro-uracil administration is described. The aetiological process is not clear, and it is possible that 5-fluoro-uracil has a vasoconstrictive effect on the coronary artery system. 
518	A group of patients with idiopathic chondrolysis of the hip joint reported on in 1971 have been reviewed and the findings reveal no significant change in their condition. since then a further 9 patients have been encountered and the findings are included in this article. This, we feel, confirms the existence of this strange condition, which almost inevitably results in the development of a fibrous ankylosis. 
519	Vasospasm of the cat basilar artery was produced by electrical, mechanical, or chemical stimuli or by subarachnoid hemorrhage. The vasospasm induced by these stimuli was relieved by the topical application of chlorpromazine to the vascular wall. Chlorpromazine appears to be a nonspecific vasoparalytic agent. Unlike previously used substances, it is effective in resolving vasospasm caused by mechanical as well as chemical irritation. 
520	Autopsy series of 6 patients who died suddenly due to granulomatous myocarditis while receiving methyldopa [for 16 days to 3 years], most also had granulomas in liver or chronic hepatitis; no clinical information.

522	Demonstration of defective transporter for cystine in lysosomes from patients with cystinosis which results in a toxic accumulation of cystine; in contrast, the egress of methionine, tryptophan and other amino acids is normal, suggesting a specific amino acid transporter defect.
523	5 cases of severe side effects due to ticlopidine, one liver-related: 48 year old man developed jaundice and pruritus 3 months after starting ticlopidine [bilirubin 26.3 mg/dL, ALT 80 U/L, Alk P 1000 U/L], resolving over next 7 months.
524	17 year old girl swallowed 50 iron tablets [~5 g of elemental iron] and rapidly developed abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, followed by hypotension, acidosis and coagulopathy with slow recovery in levels of vitamin K dependent coagulation factors and transient liver injury [AST rising from 80 to 1296 U/L; bilirubin 1.2 to 5.0 mg/dL by day 3].
525	Small birth weight infant born to mother on cimetidine had prolonged jaundice with peak bilirubin 10 mg/dL, ALT 115 U/L, Alk P 48 at 4 days of age, resolving by 6 weeks; hypothesized that cimetidine which passes the placenta may have caused the injury.
526	"Twin 7 month olds developed irritability, vomiting and bulging fontanelles 4 months after starting a diet of chicken livers [~120 g daily], with normal ALT, Alk P and bilirubin, resolving with stopping diet [estimated 40,000 IU or 12,000 ?g daily]."
527	Review of 4 cases of hepatic angiosarcoma occurring in infants, ages 1-30 months, which had histologic features distinct from those in adults, one case attributed to arsenic exposure and three idiopathic.
528	32 year old woman with Crohn's disease on OCCs for 10 years found to have Alk P 600 U/L, ALT 25 U/L, bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL and biopsy showing peliosis, increased reticulum and thick walled arteries and fibrosis in portal areas.
529	Among 1000 episodes of phencyclidine intoxication seen at a Los Angeles medical center, median age was 23 years [range 13 to 65 years], 88% were men; 57% had nystagmus, 57% hypertension, 37% acute brain syndrome, 11% unconscious, 35% violent behavior, 34% agitated, 19% hallucinating, 3.5% no behavioral changes, 30% tachycardia, 2.6% hyperthermia; among those tested, CPK was elevated in 70% and ALT in 50%, but none had accompanying bilirubin elevations.
530	Serum from halothane hepatitis cases was cytotoxic to hepatocytes from rabbits given halothane, but only if animals were exposed to high concentrations of oxygen suggesting that oxidative metabolic pathway was involved.
531	Two patients with rheumatoid arthritis wtih penicillamine hepatotoxicity; 43 year old woman developed enzyme elevations [normal bilirubin, AST 440 U/L, Alk P ~2 times ULN] without symptoms 2 months after starting penicillamine, resolving rapidly on stopping and recurring with rechallenge; 60 year old man developed jaundice 2 weeks after starting penicillamine [bilirubin 2.2 mg/dL, AST 128 U/L, Alk P 8 times ULN], resolving slowly over next 9 months.
532	"Among 55 patients receiving cancer chemotherapy given intramuscular injections of trimethobenzamide or placebo four times daily for 48 hours, ""no side effects attributable to trimethobenzamide were recorded""."
533	Case control study of 419 patients with acute cholecystitis and 1676 controls found increased frequency of recent use of thiazides [14% vs 8%: relative risk of 2.0].
534	53 year old woman developed rash and fever 7 days after starting imipramine followed by jaundice with eosinophilia [bilirubin 10 mg/dL, AST 115 U/L, Alk P ~4 times ULN], with persistent jaundice and severe pruritus for 1 year, followed by gradual improvement; but 12 year follow up showed minor alkaline phosphatase and AST elevations with normal bilirubin; liver biopsies showed duct absence initially, but returning in follow up, although fibrosis was present.
535	Between 1966 and 1976, 921 adverse events due to nitrofurantoin were reported to a Swedish registry; 50 [6%] of which were hepatic, including 1 fatality due to cirrhosis; mean age 59 years, 86% women, half with latency <1 month, but some with latency >1 year.
536	67 year old developed elevations in liver tests 7 months after starting cimetidine [bilirubin 2 mg/dL, ALT 246 U/L, Alk P 216 U/L], which returned to normal 3 months later with positive rechallenge during which liver biopsy showed centrozonal necrosis with occasional bridging: Case 1.
537	Review of flutamide events reported to FDA MedWatch 1989-1994, found 20 deaths and 26 hospitalizations for flutamide hepatotoxicity ~3/10,000; autopsy in 6 showed massive necrosis, mean onset of 3 months after starting; found 16 cases in literature.
538	Among 6 patients with sickle cell disease [ages 13 to 46 years] who were treated with phenylbutyrate [13 g/m2 daily] for 8-43 days, all had an increase in fetal hemoglobin, but compliance was poor and adverse events included rash, sodium overload, edema and fever; no mention of ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity.
539	79 year old man with myelofibrosis developed fever and diarrhea 20 days after starting hydroxyurea [normal white counts, no mention of liver tests], which resolved within 24 hours of stopping.
540	44 year old woman developed jaundice 2 weeks after finishing a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin [bilirubin 9.6 mg/dL, ALT 745 U/L, Alk P 284 U/L], with full recovery requiring 5 months.
541	Controlled trial of 14 days of fluconazole vs nystatin in 182 children with oropharyngeal candidiasis; liver test abnormalities occurred in 8% on nystatin vs 7% on fluconazole; no early discontinuations because of abnormalities.
542	39 year old man with tuberculosis developed fever and rash 2 weeks after starting allopurinol; initially with normal liver tests, but then developing lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia [bilirubin normal, ALT 413 U/L, Alk P 143 U/L], resolving rapidly after stopping allopurinol.
543	The development of models of both Candida albicans and mixed C. albicans/Escherichia coli/Bacillus fragilis peritonitis in immunologically normal mice are described, each with significant mortality and intra-abdominal abscess formation. C. albicans inoculated alone induced bacterial translocation into abscesses, and the addition of bacteria reduced the number of, but did not eliminate. C. albicans in abscesses. There was no synergy seen between fungi and bacteria in terms of either morbidity or mortality. 
544	With an assay that generates superoxide anion radicals without the intervention of metal ions we investigated the antioxidant properties of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with a sulfhydryl group. Under these conditions, increasing concentrations of the drug were seen not to scavenge O.-2 directly. However, a combination of captopril and iron could bring about the breakdown of the superoxide anion; a result that may help to understand the free radical-scavenging properties of captopril. 
545	Forty-two cases of the viral encephalitis have been analysed clinically and epidemiologically. On the basis of a literature review and own observations the author discusses the aetiology, diagnosis, clinical course and treatment of encephalitis caused by viruses. An emphasis in the diagnostic methods (serodiagnosis and viral isolations) was presented. Attention is called to the early treatment with antiviral drugs. 
546	The author gives an account on the effect of a number of nutrients prepared by the pharmaceutical industry and their use in enteral and parenteral nutrition. They are natural substances which promote the action of other pharmaceutical preparations. Their main importance is in prevention: they prevent a number of complications, have no side-effects and there is no risk of overdosage. 
547	The blood plasma and urinary pattern of polyamines and pyrimidines in dogs bearing mammary tumours was examined. A large variability of pyrimidines in blood plasma and spermidine, spermine and pseudouridine in urine of healthy and tumour-bearing dogs was observed. The blood plasma level of uracil and uridine as well as urinary concentration of pseudouridine and spermidine/spermine ratio were significantly elevated in dogs with mammary tumours. 
548	We describe a patient with recurrence of Hodgkin's disease and severe liver disease of unknown origin in whom autoimmune neutropenia developed. Because of possible seronegative viral hepatitis he was treated with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin instead of steroids. He responded with a prompt but transitory increase of the neutrophil count and recovered completely after chemotherapy. 
549	Endoscopic interventional techniques have created a wide new perspective for non-surgical treatment of chronic pancreatitis (CP). Surgery and endoscopy differ in their techniques, but are comparable with regard to tactics. The aim of methods in CP is to relieve pain and/or local complications. The preliminary results of endoscopic procedures in CP are promising and the methods appear safe in the hands of experienced endoscopists. 
550	The syndrome of cardiovascular involvement is one of the most frequently occurring syndromes in the toxicogenic phase of acute poisonings in children. Analysis of the results of comprehensive examination of cardiac function in 168 infants poisoned with clopheline, caustic poisons, barbiturates, and amitriptyline showed changes in the ECG and central and peripheral hemodynamics which are characteristic of each type of poisonings. 
551	We report a patient who developed cutaneous metastases in a lymphoedematous leg, from a follicular centre cell lymphoma, in a setting of lymphoedema praecox and recurrent deep-vein thromboses. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a case. We discuss the possible causes for this localization. 
552	Despite improvements in treatment and survival rates for some types of cancer, there remains a need to develop new treatment strategies for the majority of solid tumours. This article describes the cytokines most commonly used and examines the implications for the patient and nursing management. 
553	A sensitive liquid chromatographic analysis for myo-inositol was developed using glycocyamine as the post-labelling reagent. The sensitivity was 500 pmol/injection. The system was applied to analyse myo-inositol in sera from eight patients with chronic renal failure. The average concentration of serum myo-inositol was 498.6 +/- 257.0 mumol/L before haemodialysis, and 244.0 +/- 131.1 mumol/L after haemodialysis. These results indicated that the kidney is the main site of myo-inositol metabolism. 
554	The importance of standardizing surgical pathology reports is emerging from the literature. The use of checklists has recently been proposed for diagnosing the major tumour types, but no attention has been given to non-neoplastic conditions. In this paper a checklist for standard reports of liver needle biopsies for non-neoplastic conditions is presented. 
555	In developing rabbit brain we studied expression of metalloproteinases (MMP) 1 and 3 by in situ hybridization and MMP2 and tissue and urokinase-type plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA) by immunohistochemistry. All are detected in developing cell populations. Mature olfactory bulb neurons express MMP1 and MMP3. uPA is expressed by glial cells during myelination and by mature cortical neurons. MMP2 is expressed by mature subpial and perivascular astrocytes. 
556	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) content and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity were determined in whole blood of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with and without drug treatment and compared with controls. From that comparison a significant reduction in platelet 5HT became apparent in PD. Selegiline, which was always used in combination with L-dopa, not only inhibited MAO activity, as expected, but it also appeared to induce an increase in 5HT content. 
557	Over a 6-month period, 6 of 54 postthoracotomy patients developed pneumonia and respiratory failure. Pneumonia was secondary to herpes simplex virus type 1 in 3 of the 6 patients. Diagnostic efforts including bronchoscopy with bronchial washing, viral cultures, and cytologic examination permitted early diagnosis and successful treatment with acyclovir. A high index of suspicion for herpes simplex pneumonia must be maintained in critically ill patients with undiagnosed pneumonia. 
558	A series of C-terminal linear endothelin analogues were prepared and their activities in C6 rat glioma cell line were tested. Among the synthetic analogues, IBDP 064, Fmoc-Leu-Asp-Ile-Ile-Trp-OH, was the most potent and selective inhibitor of endothelin-3-induced cell proliferation. Its action was comparable with that of the previously described peptide IRL 1038, [Cys11-Cys15]-ET-1(11-21), an ETB specific inhibitor. 
559	Summary analysis of 180 cases of diclofenac hepatotoxicity reported to FDA during 3 year period; 67% symptomatic, 50% jaundiced; 8% mortality in patients with jaundice; latency 1-6 months in 85% of cases; hepatocellular enzyme pattern in most.
560	Results of dynamic investigation of beta-endorphins and hormonal state were analysed in 34 patients with pancreonecrosis aged from 23 to 54 years. The dependency of this indexes on the severity of clinical course and presence of complications was determined. The correction ways of injurious action of stress-reaction in pancreonecrosis were proposed. 
561	Complex investigations of hepatoportal circulation and hepatic functional reserve were conducted in 90 patients with liver cirrhosis and the portal hypertension syndrome in the stages of compensation, sub- and decompensation. While the disease grow progressing the indexes of common hepatic blood flow and its components lowers, hyperdynamic state of splenic circulation changes to congested one. Hemodynamic disturbances mentioned are making for hepatic functional reserve worsen. 
562	A case of a stage IB gastric cancer associated with spontaneous muscle atrophy of both hands is reported. The cause of this atrophy was not apparent with current neurologic diagnostic modalities. Although the association of gastric cancer with muscle atrophy may be coincidental, it may be part of a paraneoplastic syndrome. 
563	We experienced complete remission in a patient with postoperative abdominal lymph node recurrence of intrathoracic esophageal cancer after treatment with radiation (60Co: 30 Gy) and split CF therapy (CDDP: 20 mg/day + 5-FU: 1 g/day for 5 days). Since then, this patient has remained in complete remission for 43 months with intermittent split CF therapy one or two times a year. 
564	The effect of Ca2+ on the glucose transporter of human erythrocytes was investigated. The results showed that extracellular Ca2+ had no effect. But, the glucose transport of erythrocytes was markedly inhibited due to the increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration by addition of ionophore A23187. The Ca2+ inhibition exhibited a dose-dependent manner with an apparent half maximal concentration of 250 microM and could not be recovered by 10 mM EGTA. Unlike Ca2+, Mg2+ did not affect the glucose transporter. 
565	The expression of CD25 and CD45RO in lymphocytes from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in response to cytomegalovirus and varicella-zoster virus antigens was analyzed by flow cytometry. It is suggested that the defects in the immune response to cytomegalovirus and varicella-zoster virus in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia on chemotherapy are in the expression of CD25 and in the switching of CD45RA cells to CD45RO cells. 
566	We report a case of cerebral air embolism caused by right subclavian vein catheterization. A large amount of air was seen only over the left cerebral hemisphere on computed tomographic (CT) scans. Although neurological deficit was observed bilaterally at the onset, the degree of ischemic brain damage was far greater in the left cerebral hemisphere than in the right. This unusual left-sided predominancy of cerebral air embolism was presumably due to the tortuosity of the ascending aorta. 
567	Numerous case-control studies have suggested a link between the oral contraceptive pill and liver cancer. The secular trends in liver cancer mortality rates for England and Wales from 1975 to 1992 were examined to determine whether an effect of the pill was apparent. Liver cancer mortality has remained constant in women in the age groups that have had major exposure to the pill. 
568	Nipple secretion is an important clinical symptom in the context of breast pathology second only, in terms of incidence and diagnostic role, to the presence of a mammary nodule. Its importance derives from its possible association with cancer (from 3% to 47%) of which it may be the earliest sign, even if it is most often in relation to a benign pathology. The authors report their experience from 1988 to the present in 60 cases of mammary secretion out of 1200 patients attending the clinic. 
569	Mesenteric arteriovenous fistulas or arterioportal fistulas (APF) are rare and mostly secondary to penetrating abdominal wounds. A rare case of APF presenting 2 years later a blunt abdominal trauma has been reported. On the basis of a review of the literature (65 cases) the etiology, clinical findings, diagnostical aspects and the results of conservative and surgical treatment have been analyzed. 
570	The belief in delayed antidepressant action has been encouraged by a confusion between the concepts of full response and the appearance of improvement. Conventional trial designs are insufficiently sensitive to detect early significant separation of drug and placebo. Analysis of time to response is a more sensitive measure to detect early differences in improvement and 2-week studies are therefore proposed as a valid method to demonstrate antidepressant efficacy. 
571	CRP is an acute phase protein (APP) formed by hepatic cells in acute phase reaction (APR). APR is initiated by a broad spectrum of cytokines of activated macrophages of blood and tissues. During the APR, plasma concentrations of APP are changed. Cytokines regulate APPs. CRP is a phylogenetically very old molecule. The degree of homology of amino acids in CRP is very high in a lot of species. CRP binding specificities depend on Ca++. The diagnostic importance of CRP in veterinary medicine is discussed. 
572	Thorough review of structure, pharmacology, efficacy and safety of nabumetone; among 1677 patients, 0.4% showed marked elevations in both ALT and AST, but no mention of clinically apparent liver injury or jaundice.
573	58 year old man with prostate cancer developed jaundice 6 weeks after starting flutamide [bilirubin 11 mg/dL, ALT 348 U/L, Alk P 276 U/L, protime 34% and ascites], nevertheless, recovering within one month of stopping.
574	Among 51 Italian patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate weekly for up to 3 years, 14% had transient ALT or AST elevations, all resolving spontaneously or with dose modification.
575	The results of the endolymphatic chemotherapy application in patients with metastatic cancer of stomach are presented. The low toxicity and high effectiveness were suggested. One-year survival was achieved in 42.2% of patients. 
576	Myxedema coma is a fatal condition when left unrecognized. With the advent of intensive supportive therapy and the use of intravenous thyroxine, however, mortality for this disorder is declining. Further insights into the pathophysiology of hypothyroidism should lead to more rational approaches to therapy and result in improved survival. 
577	The introduction of this article is devoted to the physiological role of vitamin D3 and its synthesis. The authors refer to the accidental introduction of vitamin D3 into the psoriasis treatment, which later led to the development of a less toxic vitamin D3 analog named calcipotriol, and its administration as a topical antipsoriatic agent. Reviewing the literature the authors discuss the pharmacological and immunological effects of calcipotriol as well as the potential applications of vitamin D3. 
578	Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown aetiology. The role of radiology is not only to support the clinical diagnosis but also as an adjunct to monitor the course and progression of the disease. The cornerstone of radiological assessment is the plain radiograph, however newer imaging methods are producing more information in relation to the anatomical distribution and pathophysiology which may ultimately have a profound effect on the management of this protean disease. 
579	"Anti-smoking counseling by physicians has demonstrated to be the treatment modality of smokers with the best cost-benefit ratio. The basic stages of physician intervention are summarized in the four ""A's"" of clinical activities: ask, advise, assist, arrange. The systematic use of this methodology by the health teams could achieve 80000 ex-smokers per year in our country. "
580	Motor vehicle crash (MVC) deaths in Wisconsin have steadily declined since the 1970s. Multiple prevention strategies have been applied resulting in the lowest MVC death rate in 30 years. If current trends continue, firearms will exceed MVCs in Wisconsin by the year 2001. Multiple prevention strategies based on the public health model need to be applied to firearms. 
581	The usefulness of two commercial immunoassays for the detection of diarrheal enterotoxin of Bacillus cereus is unclear because the identity of the enterotoxin(s) has not been proven and the kits detect different proteins. We found that the Bacillus cereus Enterotoxin-Reversed Passive Latex Agglutination kit (Oxoid) detects the L2 component from hemolysin BL, and the Bacillus Diarrhoeal Enterotoxin Visual Immunoassay (Tecra) detects two apparently nontoxic proteins. 
582	A patient with acute interstitial nephritis secondary to ingestion of a Chinese herbal medicine adulterated with mefenamic acid is presented. Following hemodialysis and cessation of the medication the patient's renal function returned to normal. 
583	"Following the introductory informative consideration of the conception of public health in different countries, the author quotes the first reports on public health service in the history of the ""Kingdom of Bohemia"". In the following text he considers the development of this service, emphasizes the role of the National Institute of Public Health and gives a survey of its brief history until its reestablishment on January 1, 1992. "
584	Ninety-two patients in long-term treatment for obesity completed a questionnaire on the weight development of their close family members. Of 47 such relatives, 37 had lost a mean of 6.1 kg and 10 increased a mean of 5.1 kg. Treatment of obesity will affect many more than those taking part in the actual program and generally result in weight loss. This effect on family members was mostly considered beneficial. 
585	A man with metastatic small cell carcinoma of the bladder who was treated with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin therapy achieved complete remission with disease-free survival of more than 9 years. The nature of this unusual form of bladder carcinoma and the course of the disease in our case are discussed. 
586	Among 144 patients with hairy cell leukemia treated with cladribine, 82% achieved a complete remission and side effects were few, but included fever in 42%; no mention of ALT abnormalities or hepatotoxicity.
587	60 year old woman developed jaundice 10 months after starting chaparral [and 3 weeks after dose increase] with progressive liver failure [bilirubin 12.4 rising to 35.5 mg/dL, ALT 341 U/L, Alk P 186 U/L, protime 15.9 rising to 28 seconds], undergoing successful emergency liver transplantation.

590	40 year old man developed liver enzyme elevations 6 weeks after starting clozapine [bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, ALT 594 U/L, Alk P167 U/L], without symptoms and resolving within 4 weeks of stopping; rechallenge led to minor, transient ALT elevations falling to normal on long-term use [>1 year].
591	Among 55,000 children in a prospective controlled trial who were given ibuprofen or acetaminophen for fever, no child developed Reye syndrome or clinically apparent liver injury.
592	Review of the clinical uses of gabapentin largely as add-on to other anticonvulsants. Most common side effects were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, nystagmus, headache, tremor, diplopia, nausea and rhinitis. “No serious idiosyncratic reactions have been identified with gabapentin and, in particular, there is no evidence of hypersensitivity reactions…”.
593	Review and update of fatal cases of valproate hepatotoxicity from Germany-Switzerland, risk factors were found to be age <2 years and cases were rare in patients above 18 years; onset can occur >6 months after onset, often presenting with worsening seizures, nausea and apathy after a febrile illness.

601	55 year old developed jaundice following treatment with 1 week of ranitidine and 1 week of famotidine [bilirubin 7.1 mg/dL, ALT 305 U/L, Alk P 182 U/L] with rapid resolution on stopping: Case 1.
602	The establishment and maintenance of epithelial-cell polarity are prerequisites for normal epithelial-cell and organ function. Knowledge of the processes involved in cell polarity has provided insight into the mechanisms of cell dysfunction and the pathogenesis of several diseases. These insights should lead to the development of specific strategies aimed at preventing or minimizing the progression of these diseases.
603	Pathological review of liver resections from 72 patients showed nodular regenerative hyperplasia in 5, all of whom had colon cancer metastases and had been treated with chemotherapy: usually 5-fluorouracil; 9 patients had hyperplastic foci some of whom had received cisplatin and other agents including cyclophosphamide, VP-16 and carmustine.
604	36 year old woman with systemic lupus developed jaundice 2 months after starting 100 mg of cyclophosphamide daily [bilirubin 9.2 mg/dL, ALT 2515 U/L, Alk P 456 U/L, INR normal, eosinophils 14%], resolving in 4 weeks upon stopping: Case 2.

617	Four cases of pennyroyal toxicity; 24 year old woman took pennyroyal oil to induce abortion and developed nausea, syncope and cardiopulmonary arrest and later died of multiorgan failure [AST rising from 49 to 2672 U/L], autopsy showing centrilobular necrosis; 22 month old girl drank pennyroyal oil and was treated with gastric lavage and N-acetylcysteine within an hour and thereafter had no liver test abnormalities; two other cases had mild dizziness and gastrointestinal symptoms after pennyroyal tea ingestion.
618	76 liver biopsies from 36 patients with psoriasis treated with methotrexate for 1-5 years were studied by immunohistochemistry showing slight and progressive increases in laminin, fibronectin and collagen in biopsies, with minimal or no changes by light microscopy.
619	Prospective study of liver tests in 65 prostate cancer patients given flutamide and goserelin for 4 months; ALT rose above normal in 62%, and to >5 times ULN in 7%; 14 patients stopped therapy early because of ALT levels; 2 patients developed hepatitis [bilirubin 3.9 and 3.8 mg/dL, ALT 1116 and 816 U/L], all resolved within 3 months of stopping.
620	Comparison of 86 patients with hepatitis due to antituberculosis therapy with 406 patients who tolerated therapy; risk factors were older age, history of high alcohol intake [20% vs 5%], more extensive disease [14% vs 3.5%], slow acetylator status [83% vs 64%] and use of pyrazinamide [63% vs 25%].
621	69 year old woman developed severe cholestatic hepatitis after 7 years of glyburide therapy, but 2 weeks after dose increase [15/mg/day] [bilirubin 5.0 rising to 49 mg/dL, peak ALT 87 U/L, Alk P 583 U/L], subsequently developing progressive hepatic failure and death.
622	74 year old developed rash 5 days after starting oral dicloxacillin [bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, ALT 172 U/L, Alk P 183 U/L], biopsy showing a single granuloma and mild nonspecific changes, ultimately resolving within 4 months of stopping

626	"Review of pharmacology, efficacy and safety of galantamine in Alzheimer disease; most side effects are due to its cholinergic properties, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anxiety and dizziness; ""to date, elevations in liver enzymes or other signs of liver toxicity have not been reported with galanthamine""."
627	65 year old man with adenocarcinoma treated with 5-FU, leucovorin and cisplatin developed lethargy and coma within 48 hours of starting treatment, with normal serum enzymes and no jaundice, which resolved within 1-2 weeks and did not recur with subsequent courses of lower doses of 5-FU.
628	A case of myocardial infarction following a distal splenorenal shunt, a selective portal-systemic shunt, in a cirrhotic patient is reported. The post-operative cardiac morbidity was probably related to the hyperdynamic cardiovascular state associated with liver cirrhosis and the increase in intramyocardial tension upon formation of the distal splenorenal shunt. 
629	We describe a patient with progressive systemic sclerosis who developed ischemic colitis and scleroderma renal crisis following steroid pulse therapy. The possible pathogenic mechanisms of ischemic colitis and scleroderma renal crisis development are discussed. We conclude that the administration of steroids in high doses, especially via steroid pulse therapy, should be undertaken with caution for progressive systemic sclerosis patients. 
630	Evidence exists for a potential role for inhaled corticosteroids, particularly when used in high dose to cause growth impairment, delayed maturation and adrenal suppression in children adolescents with asthma. The functional significance of biochemical adrenal suppression remains uncertain. Similarly, there is as yet insufficient evidence to determine whether inhaled corticosteroids may adversely affect bone mineral density in children and adolescents with asthma. 
631	Changes of the rat skin and mesenteric microvascular permeability for Na-fluorescine were studied during adaptation to intermittent hypobaric hypoxia. The data obtained revealed that the microvascular permeability increased on the 10 th day after the hypoxia and decreased within 25 days of hte adaptation to the hypoxia in both areas under study. 
632	Gross hemorrhage is the most serious complication of anticoagulant therapy. We report the discovery and treatment of a large pseudoaneurysm of the superior gluteal artery in one patient who had been receiving oral anticoagulant therapy. We diagnosed the pseudoaneurysm by contrast-enhanced computed tomography, and embolized the artery with stainless steel coils. The exact cause of the pseudoaneurysm remains unclear, however, minor trauma appears most likely. 
633	Ten patients with primary fibromyalgia syndrome were treated with intravenous infusions of lignocaine on a daily basis for six days. This treatment produced a clinically useful improvement in pain relief and mood scores at the time of discharge on day seven and at follow-up on day thirty. 
634	Antibacterial effect of compounds extracted from Camellia sinensis L. and the methanol extract of Euphorbia hirta L. were studied against dysentery causing Shigella spp. using the Vero cell line. Cytotoxicity studies of the extracts were performed using the cell line and the non-cytotoxic concentration of the extract was tested for antibacterial activity against the cytopathic dose of the pathogen. These extracts were found to be non-cytotoxic and effective antibacterial agents. 
635	(R,S)-alpha-chlorohydrin-1-phosphate, previously shown to have no anti-glycolytic activity on mature boar sperm in vitro, is a substrate for acid and/or neutral phosphatase(s) that are associated with washed sperm. The high phosphatase activity hydrolyses the ester to alpha-chlorohydrin which undergoes oxidation to (S)-3-chlorolactaldehyde, a specific inhibitor of sperm glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and triosephosphate isomerase, thereby exhibiting an anti-glycolytic action. 
636	Report of the crystal structure of the NS3/4 region of HCV with detailed description of the active serine protease catalytic site, the target for subsequent development of specific inhibitors of the HCV protease.
637	Among 14 liver transplant recipients treated with isoniazid, all five given combination therapy developed hepatitis after 1-4 months, 4 were jaundiced, and all recovered [bilirubin 0.5-16.0 mg/dL], later tolerating ethambutol and ofloxacin; in contrast, isoniazid monotherapy was tolerated with only mild ALT elevations.

643	Randomized trial of 2 doses of etodolac vs ibuprofen in 1446 patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated for up to 3 years; similar efficacy; “Changes in hepatic and renal function were similar across treatment groups” and “rates… were low”, but higher dose of etodolac had higher rate of Alk P elevations; all resolved with stopping.
644	Among 168 patients with diabetes on insulin therapy treated with 1 of 3 doses of pramlintide or placebo 4 times daily for a 2 week period, side effects included nausea, anorexia and dyspepsia; no mention of ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity.
645	Among 10 patients with severe aplastic anemia arising 1-7 weeks after onset of acute seronegative hepatitis who were treated with horse ATG [4 days] and cyclosporine [6 months], the long term response rate was 70%, and ALT levels fell in all 10 patients, becoming normal within 30 days in 9.
646	Current dose of albendazole for therapy of echinococosis is 800 mg daily for ~3 months; serum enzyme elevations occurred in 10-20% of patients, requiring discontinuation in 4%, all cases were reversible, some possibly due to underlying liver cyst disease.
647	Review of metabolism and literature on hepatotoxicity of halogenatic anesthetics: halothane is extensively metabolized [oxidized] by the liver and major metabolite is TFA which may be a toxic intermediary metabolite.
648	55 year old woman with chronic hepatitis developed jaundice one month after starting Dai-saiko-to [bilirubin 11.2 mg/dL, ALT 390 U/L, ANA 1:2560], responding rapidly to prednisone therapy.
649	Case control study in cohort of 100,000 users of antiulcer drugs in a UK general practice database; 33 cases of acute liver injury found, 12 on cimetidine for a relative risk [RR] of 5.5, 1 on omeprazole and 5 on ranitidine did not raise RR above baseline. Latency was <2 months in 80% of cases; most antiulcer drug cases had hepatocellular or mixed enzyme patterns [15 of 18].

652	Extensive review of side effects of tramadol from phase II-IV studies in 21,000 patients from 1977-93; little evidence of respiratory depression or dependence with oral administration; no mention of hepatotoxicity.
653	24 year old man developed rash after 1 week and fever after 3 weeks of lamotrigine therapy [bilirubin 1.7 mg/dL, ALT 130 U/L, Alk P 274 U/L], resolving within 3 weeks on intravenous methylprednisolone; review of rates of rash in clinical trials of lamotrigine found reports of rash in 0.3% of adults and 1% of children; Stevens-Johnson syndrome in 0.1% of adults and 0.5% of children.
654	"In a study comparing atorvastatin [10 to 20 mg] to simvastatin [10 to 20 mg] for 1 year in 177 patients with hypercholesterolemia, there were ""no clinically important elevations in ALT, AST or CPK"" during treatment with either statin."
655	Safety analysis in over 4000 patients on meloxicam; fewer gastrointestinal complaints with meloxicam; similar data as in Distel [1996]: ALT levels >2 times ULN occurred in 2% of meloxicam vs 5% of diclofenac recipients; no mention of hepatitis or jaundice.
656	47 year old man and 57 year old woman with HIV infection presented with weakness and fatigue 6 and 9 months after starting zidovudine [bilirubin 2.7 and 0.8 mg/dL, ALT 85 and 109 U/L and Alk P 59 U/L], with progressive lactic acidosis and death; autopsy showed extensive hepatic steatosis.
657	65 year old woman developed jaundice 2 months aftter starting ticlopidine [bilirubin 6.9 mg/dL, ALT 251 U/L, Alk P 1158 U/L], with incomplete resolution 3 months later when she died of a stroke.
658	47 year old man developed pruritus and jaundice one month after starting amoxicillin-clavulanate [bilirubin 11.6 mg/dL, ALT 159 U/L, Alk P 195 U/L, 4% eosinophils], resolving within 3 months.
659	Among 93 patients treated with fluconazole for up to several years, ALT elevations occurred in 2 and AST in 9 patients, none symptomatic or requiring discontinuation.
660	"Among 77 patients with breast cancer receiving intensive chemotherapy who were treated with IL-11 [50 µg/kg] or placebo injections daily for 10 or 17 days, IL-11 decreased the need for platelet transfusion and was ""well tolerated"", side effects being edema [63% vs 14%], dyspnea [48% vs 19%], pleural effusions [18% vs 0%], conjunctival injection [25% vs 0%]; no mention of ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity."
661	Meta analysis using individual data from 13 trials of amiodarone in 6553 patients showed reduction in cardiac mortality of 13%; liver dysfunction more common with amiodarone than placebo [1% vs 0.4%], but no description of abnormalities.
662	Two cases of jaundice in men, ages 76 and 64 years, with prostate cancer given flutamide for 16 and 8 weeks [bilirubin 8.9 and 8.4 mg/dL, ALT 699 and 612 U/L, Alk P 206 and 241 U/L, one patient with ascites], resolving within 9-10 weeks of stopping.
663	The Na+-dependent bile salt uptake systems Ntcp (rodents) and NTCP (human), and the Na+-independent organic anion transporters oatpl (rat) and OATP (human) mediate sinusoidal uptake of a variety of amphipathic organic compounds into hepatocytes. Their properties indicate that an overall hepatic clearance of albumin-bound compounds is mediated by a limited number of multispecific transporters with partially overlapping substrate specificities.
664	"Controlled trial of naltrexone vs placebo in 865 alcohol dependent patients; common side effects were nausea and headache; ALT levels tended to decrease during therapy and were similar in the two groups: ""No clinically important abnormalities were noted..."", but 3 patients stopped naltrexone early because of ALT elevations [156, 162 and 563 U/L at weeks 2-8 of therapy], which resolved rapidly thereafter."

666	Three patients, 86, 83 and 72 year olds, 2 men and 1 woman, developed jaundice 1-2 months after starting ticlopidine [bilirubin 3.2, 11.1 and 25.3 mg/dL, ALT 196, 363 and 225 U/L, Alk P 1033, 2130 and 1072 U/L], resolving 1-2 months after stopping.
667	46 year old woman developed fatigue and jaundice a few weeks after reaching a dose of 10 g/day of SR niacin [bilirubin 6.2 mg/dL, ALT 2081 U/L, Alk P 295 U/], resolving within 3 weeks of stopping.
668	"75 year old man with Paget's disease and diabetes developed elevations in serum ALT [33 to 413 U/L] and AST [36 to 322 U/L] and worsening Alk P [470 to 684 U/L], without symptoms or jaundice after 2 months of metformin therapy; rechallenge for 1 month was not followed by recurrence; authors concluded that this represented ""pseudohepatotoxicity""."
669	Short summary of the mechanism of action, clinical efficacy, adverse events and costs of toremifene shortly after its approval for use in the United States mentions that serum aminotransferase elevations have been reported in patients on therapy.
670	26 year old man developed dry eyes and dry mouth 4 days after finishing a second course of thiabendazole [25 mg/kg for 3 days] for strongyloidiasis, with subsequent jaundice [bilirubin 18.3 mg/dL, ALT 2.5 times ULN, Alk P 1.5 times ULN], liver biopsy showed intrahepatic cholestasis and loss of bile ducts; subsequent persistent severe cholestasis evolving into cirrhosis; liver transplant 1.5 years after onset.
671	Hydroxyurea is hydroxylated analogue of urea and suppresses DNA replication by inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, a necessary step in deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis; its hepatic metabolism is not well characterized, but is probably via the cytochrome P450 system; discussion of side effects mentions liver enzyme elevations.
672	Two women, ages 57 and 59 years, developed symptomatic but anicteric hepatitis 9 months and 3 years after starting lovastatin [bilirubin 0.8 and 1.3 mg/dL, ALT 244 and 273 U/L, Alk P 845 and 306 U/L], resolving rapidly on stopping.
673	Randomized controlled trial of montelukast [n=408] or placebo [n=273] for 12 weeks found similar rates of adverse events, with abnormal ALT in 2.5% of montelukast and 1.5% of placebo recipients and no hepatitis or discontinuation because of liver abnormalities.
674	"Among 380 kidney transplant recipients given basiliximab or placebo on day 0 and 4 after transplant followed by standard immunsuppressive therapy, acute rejection within 6 months was less with basiliximab [30% vs 44%], but the pattern and frequency of side effects were similar and ""no clinically relevant differences were found between the two groups in terms of changes in laboratory indices""."
675	22 year old woman developed jaundice several months after starting piroxicam [bilirubin 7.8 mg/dL, ALT 387 U/L, Alk P 784 U/L], resolving within 8 weeks of stopping.
676	At no time in the past have the basic and clinical sciences applied to Parkinson's disease been so active. Experimental therapies under study at present promise to improve on the limitations of existing treatments. Future progress in understanding the causation and pathogenesis of the disorder will permit the development of new treatments that will slow, halt, or even reverse the currently inexorable progressive course of Parkinson's disease.
677	"Description of patterns of change in urinary, hepatic and serum copper and zinc levels and liver tests in 141 patients with Wilson disease treated with zinc; adverse reactions were ""minimal"", the most common being initial abdominal discomfort."
678	"36 year old with HIV-HCV coinfection developed ascites 9 months after starting lamivudine, indinavir and stavudine [bilirubin 2.1 mg/dL, ALT 60 U/L, and Alk P 107 U/L], with subsequent liver failure; biopsy showed nodularity and ""cirrhosis""."
679	Review of pharmacology, clinical use and safety of candesartan: studies in 4147 patients given doses of 8 or 16 mg daily found low rate of adverse events, headache in 10%, cough in 1.6%, similar rates with placebo; ALT elevations occur in “occasional” patients, reported in 2 of 632 patients in one trial of candesartan given for 12 months.
680	Summary of warnings placed on isotretinoin regarding suicide and potential of liver test abnormalities; 15% of patients on therapy had some degree of liver test abnormality arising on therapy, mostly asymptomatic and resolving without altering dose.
681	In 27 of 28 children with congenital lactic acidosis, cerebrospinal fluid lactate was higher than venous blood lactate. The mean +/- SEM difference between these variables was 2.4 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (P =.0001). Girls or patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency had higher cerebrospinal fluid lactate concentrations than boys or patients with respiratory chain defects or mitochondrial DNA mutations. 
682	Among 95 patients with ulcerative colitis treated with balsalazide [3 g daily] or mesalamine [1.2 g daily] for up to 12 months, mean serum ALT levels decreased slightly on balsalazide [2 U/L] but increased on mesalamine [2 U/L], but no hepatic adverse events were mentioned.
683	We describe the case of a 68 years-old who developed 2 attacks of acute pancreatitis during the treatment with isoniazid used as a chemoprophylactic. There was not recurrence of symptoms for the last year after isoniazid was withdrawn. This report suggest that isoniazid can induce acute pancreatitis. 
684	Splenoportal thrombosis may appear in subclinical way and it necessary te make a differential diagnosis with other pathologies-more common, like inflammatory of infection, processes conditions in which a decrease in portal-flow take place, space compromise or hypercoagulability conditions. Hear we present two cases with this pathology, and we make an extensive differential diagnosis, the final diagnosis was reached through a bone marrow aspirate, with the outcome of essential thrombocytosis. 
685	The antiphospholipid syndrome, disorder in which venous and arterial thrombosis may occur, has been described in association with systemic lupus erythematosus and later in a great variety of entities, including infectious diseases. It has been described recently a high frequency of antiphospholipid syndrome in patients with chronic hepatitis C. We present a case of cirrhosis with hepatitis C virus markers and criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome, and we review the literature. 
686	Defects in stomatin, alpha-adducin, and beta-adducin have been implicated in erythrocyte disorders of cation permeability. We performed linkage analysis of the genetic loci for these proteins in a large kindred with xerocytosis (dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis). Using polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping techniques, all three loci are excluded as disease gene candidates. 
687	The dosage of cyclosporine administered in the treatment of autoimmune diseases has generally been comparable to those required in cases of transplantation. Here we report on the successful treatment using an extremely low dose cyclosporine (1 mg/kg/day) on four patients, involving thrombocytopenia with systemic lupus erythematosus, and interstitial pneumonitis with SjĂ¶gren's syndrome, and discuss the optimal dose of cyclosporine for autoimmune-mediated manifestations. 
688	Among 683 patients with onychomycosis given intermittent 1 week itraconazole courses monthly for 3 months, only one developed ALT elevations [91 U/L], which apparently resolved spontaneously.
689	51 hepatic adenomas and 143 focal nodular hyperplasias [FNHs] accrued by 15 medical centers in Germany between 1990-97 and compared to 240 controls; OCC use reported in 94% of adenoma and 96% of FNH cases compared to 70% of controls, but odds ratios were not significant after controlling for age; slight increase in FNH with longer duration of use.
690	Letter from FDA in response to 3 reports in the Annals; FDA received 560 reports of troglitazone associated hepatotoxicity, including 27 with acute liver failure [3 transplanted]. In clinical trials, 0.8% of patients stopped troglitazone because of ALT elevations; provides table of results of a fatal case in whom ALT rose from 89 to 933 U/L between weeks 57 and 90 and suggested that all elevations [not just those >3 times ULN] should be closely followed.
691	84 year old woman developed cirrhosis after 5 years of amiodarone therapy [400 mg/day] [bilirubin normal, ALT 154 U/L, Alk P 316 U/L]; despite stopping drug, patient developed liver decompensation, worsening jaundice and died 4 months later.
692	In a metaanalysis of 10 trials in 270 patients comparing baclofen and tizanidine, both agents were said to be generally well tolerated; but, no mention was made of ALT abnormalities or hepatotoxicity.
693	Controlled trial of ziprasidone in two doses [n=210] vs placebo [n=92] for 6 weeks; “Changes in liver enzymes were notably rare.” Three of 210 patients had ALT above 3 times ULN, but these were judged to be unrelated to drug therapy; further characterization not given.
694	Review of hepatotoxicity of phenothiazines, butyrophenones, tricyclics, MAO inhibitors, acetylcholesterase inhibitors, and psychotropic drugs of abuse; “benzodiazepines…have a very low hepatotoxic potential, with only case reports in the literature, usually with a cholestatic pattern”.
695	Retinoid status with reference to beta-carotene and retinol has been studied in women suffering from hyper- and hypothyroid conditions. The interrelationship between the retinoids and triiodothyronine and thyroxine hormones has been established from the cases mentioned after estimation of the respective compounds from the blood serum. It has been found that there is an increase in beta-carotene and retinol in the hypothyroid and a decrease of the same in the hyperthyroid conditions respectively. 
696	The selective Na+/Ca2+ exchange inhibitor 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea methanesulfonate (KB-R7943), significantly improves recovery of population spike amplitudes in rat hippocampal slices after hypoxia/hypoglycemia. Our data suggest that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, operating in reverse mode, contributes to hypoxia/hypoglycemia-induced injury in CA1 neurons. 
697	Mesenteric ischemia after cardiac surgery is rare but dramatic. We present a patient who had acute mesenteric ischemia following low cardiac output after coronary artery bypass grafting. Our patient was successfully treated with continuous intra-arterial perfusion with papaverine. We think that selective angiography must be performed as early as mesenteric ischemia is suspected, to get earlier diagnosis and treatment of an ischemic patient. 
698	The past few years have seen significant controversy over the diagnosis and management of gestational diabetes and its influence on perinatal outcomes. The debate over who to screen and how to screen continues to rage. Even when a diagnosis has been made, there is a lack of consensus regarding appropriate management protocols and glycemic targets. In this review, we will examine many of the controversial areas in gestational diabetes, using contemporary data to discuss these issues. 
699	The authors report a case of neurologic manifestations revealing Richter's syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cranial nerve palsies were the initial manifestation of the disease. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis with alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase revealed the existence of a large-cell lymphoma. Clinical aspects of this unusual localization of Richter's syndrome are reviewed. 
700	Phenytoin is a highly effective and widely prescribed anticonvulsant agent. However, it is associated with both dose-related side effects and hypersensitivity reactions. Life-threatening anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome in one patient was characterized by a skin eruption and multisystem organ dysfunction. 
701	Many cardiovascular complications have been described in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), however, aortic involvement is very rare. We are reporting abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture in a 47-year old woman with SLE. The patient was admitted to our hospital with severe abdominal pain. Emergency computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The restoration of aortic flow with vascular prosthesis was performed in emergency. Postoperative course was uneventful. 
702	Disseminated herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infections are infrequent in patients receiving organ transplants, but usually have a poor outcome. We describe the case of a renal transplant patient who developed a disseminated HSV-2 infection with repeated urinary extravasations. The diagnosis was carried out using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction nested assay and it suggested HSV-2 as a possible cause of repeated urinary fistulas. 
703	Primary cardiac tumors are rare entities with a frequency between 0.0017% to 0.28%. We report a 53 year old male with a primary cardiac myofibroblastic sarcoma that presented with a hemorrhagic pericardial effusion. A review of the literature is presented with a brief discussion of the clinical presentation diagnosis and treatment of benign and malignant primary cardiac tumors. 
704	Changes in carboxyhemoglobin concentrations are studied in 18 specimens of cadaveric blood 1-2 h and 3 days after heating to 50, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 90 degrees C for 5, 10, and 20 min. The concentration of carboxyhemoglobin decreased to 15% after heating at 70-75 degrees C for 10 and 20 min. Heating to 80-90 degrees makes the measurements impossible. Five-min heating at 50-65 degrees C did not change the concentration of carboxyhemoglobin in the blood. 
705	Current knowledge concerning the use of eardrops is discussed under clinical and pharmacological aspects. The role of topical ear drops as a possible cause of ototoxicity is reviewed. Although experimental data confirm the presence of ototoxicity due to topical ear drops, the clinical relevance still remains debatable. The fact that currently used ear drops may produce a sensorineural hearing loss should not be ignored. 
706	The use of oral chemotherapy for the treatment of malignant disease is expanding. The authors' experience with oral chemotherapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer continues to grow. These therapies are well-tolerated and effective. Already, these regimens are being improved by hybridizing them with intravenous agents such as paclitaxel. Also, oral novel agents are being tested that may offer new options for the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer. 
707	Alternative medicine use in the general population has continued to dramatically increase in this decade. The research supporting the use of acupuncture treatment in other areas of medicine is compelling. In addition, herbal therapies, such as PC-SPES and St. John's Wort, may play important roles in this disease. Clinicians dealing with advanced prostate cancer need to be introduced to some of these newer treatments so they can be discussed objectively with patients. 
708	Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) digests poly(ADP-ribose), which is synthesized by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) after DNA damage. We mapped the human poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase gene to chromosome 10q11.23-21.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Since chromosomal rearrangements in thyroid papillary carcinoma and loss of heterozygosity in glioblastoma are frequently observed in this region, genetic alteration of PARG could be implicated in these diseases. 
709	Pelvic lipomatosis is a rare disease of unknown etiology characterized by benign proliferation of fat in the pelvis. We describe a 27-year-old man with pelvic and retroperitoneal lipomatosis causing a severe urinary and fecal obstruction. The diagnosis was evaluated by barium enema, intravenous urogram, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The therapeutic approach is described and discussed. 
710	Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a well-known complication of solid organ transplantation. While this disorder can often be controlled by decreasing immunosuppression, it is frequently difficult to control the resultant rejection. This case exemplifies this dilemma. To solve this problem, cyclosphosphamide (600 mg/m2) and prednisone (2 mg/kg times 5 days) were given every 3 weeks to simultaneously treat PTLD and provide immunosuppression. 
711	Surrogate outcome measures have been of interest in clinical research for a long time because of their potential ability to save time and cost. The literature, however, has numerous examples of failed surrogate measures. The definition of a surrogate outcome measure, its consideration in clinical stroke research and some of the potential mechanisms for failure of surrogate measures will be discussed. 
712	Pulmonary infections decisively contribute to morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Bacterial, mycobacterial and infections with Pneumocystis carinii have been reviewed in an article in the last issue of Respiration. In this review, viral and fungal pulmonary infections are discussed in HIV-positive patients and in patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy, stem cell or solid-organ transplantation. 
713	The in vitro antiviral activity demonstrated by aqueous extract (AE) of Achyrocline flaccida on herpes simplex virus type-1 is exerted early during the viral replication, essentially during the viral adsorption to host cells. A bioguided purification process of the AE indicated that negatively charged polysaccharides were responsible for this antiviral activity. 
714	A patient developed an epidural haematoma 6 days after removal of an epidural catheter resulting in paraplegia and death. Insertion and removal of the epidural catheter during anticoagulation with prophylactic unfractionated heparin and subsequent administration of high-dose enoxaparin (Clexane), which commenced 3 days after catheter removal, were implicated. 
715	A cross over single and multiple dose study was carried out to find out pharmacokinetic interactions between diphynylhydantoin (DPH) (35 mg/kg, p.o.) and antihypertensives enalapril (1.6 mg/kg; p.o.) and amlodipine (0.4 mg/kg, p.o.) in rhesus monkeys. Neither the plasma concentrations nor the pharmacokinetic parameters of DPH were altered by coadministration of enalapril or amlodipine, suggesting that enalapril and amlodipine can be safely administered to epileptic patients receiving phenytoin. 
716	The satisfaction of a patient at the contact with a doctor results from realisation of patient's emotional and medical needs by the doctor. Lack of satisfaction reduces patient's ability to acquire and memorize information, causes unwillingness to follow doctor's instructions, eliminates the need of prophylactic examinations and decreases the level of rational response to disease symptoms. It is an emotional barrier which often makes it impossible to archive therapeutic aim. 
717	The dropped head syndrome, which occurs in a variety of neuromuscular disorders, is usually not due to an inflammatory process and generally either self-limited or nonresponsive to therapy. We present an 80-year-old woman who developed progressive neck weakness over a few months due to a focal and restricted inflammatory process involving the neck extensor muscles. She responded dramatically to treatment with immunosuppressive therapy. 
718	Immune cells subsets were prospectively analyzed after localized radiotherapy (LRT). LRT reduced the levels of all lymphocyte subsets, with B-cells and naive T-cells being most sensitive. Lymphocyte function was suppressed, but still within the normal range. Rapid recovery of cytotoxic T-cells/natural killer cells after LRT and the functional suppression within normal levels explains the low incidence of infections after LRT. 
719	Various new aminosterols were synthesized. The antiproliferative activity of these compounds (I-IV) was studied in vitro on a continuous human non small-cell bronchopulmonary carcinoma line (NSCLC-N6) at the cell cycle level. The histograms indicate cell blockage in Phase Gl (compound I-III) associated with a reduction in the number of cells phases S and G2M and appearance of cellular debris derived from cells in Phase G1. 
720	The causes of the nontoxic goiter recurrency occurrence, the prophylactic methods and the results were analysed according to the data obtained while examination and treatment of 115 patients. The autoimmune damage of a leaved thyroidal gland remnant constitutes one of the causes of the genuine recurrency of goiter. 
721	The paper present a brief review of progress in cancer immunology in the past 50 years and its use in the immunodiagnosis, immunoprevention, and immunotherapy of cancer. Tumor markers have been a basis of the serological diagnosis of some tumors and the immunophenotyping of leukemia. Hepatitis B virus vaccination should reduce the incidence of hepatic cell carcinoma. Investigations have provided impetus to the design of molecular genetic anticancer vaccines which are being tested in the clinical setting. 
722	We report two cases of patients who underwent simultaneous triple transplants (liver-pancreas-kidney) using organs taken from a single donor in each case. The anesthetic technique and perioperative treatment of each patient is described. The favorable evolution in both cases seems to indicate that although this type of transplant may be more complex, it is nevertheless a good therapeutic option for patients suffering terminal liver failure, kidney failure or diabetes type I. 
723	Self-monitoring of anti-vitamin K treatment by patients with heart valve prostheses is a good alternative to hospital control. Self-monitoring at home allows patients more freedom and opportunity to take greater responsibility for their treatment. Experience from over a years' complication-free treatment of 12 patients is reported in the article. 
724	Olanzapine acutely induced disabling hypofrontal symptoms in a 31-year-old male. This occurred after 13 years of exposure to typical neuroleptics without such symptoms. Presumably, hypofrontal symptoms should limit the dose of atypical neuroleptics in some patients. Milder expressions of hypofrontal symptoms should be more common. 
725	To determine the plasma baclofen concentrations of children undergoing continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion for treatment of cerebral spasticity, we assayed plasma samples from six children, 8 to 18 years of age, who were receiving intrathecal baclofen at constant rates of 77 to 400 micrograms/day. Plasma levels were at or below the limit of quantification (10 ng/mL) in all patients. 
726	A model of tissue cyst formation was developed using D609, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine specific-phospholipase C. The phospholipase inhibitor induced a decrease in Toxoplasma gondii multiplication and several successive treatments could lead to an arrest in parasite multiplication and full encystment of the parasites. This could be a first step towards an in vitro model of T. gondii reactivation. 
727	Sarcoidosis remains an enigmatic disease with serious ocular morbidity. Recent literature continues to expand our knowledge of the ocular manifestations and their sequelae. Advances in diagnostic clinical testing are reviewed, including updates on angiotensin-converting enzyme levels, gallium scanning, bronchoalveolar lavage, and transbronchial lung biopsy. 
728	A new set of mutations, including transposition of the insertion sequence IS6110, was identified in the pncA gene from 19 pyrazinamide-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Alignment of the PncA protein from M. tuberculosis with homologous proteins from different bacterial species revealed three highly conserved regions in PncA which may play an important role in the processing of pyrazinamide. 
729	Two cases of fluoxetine hepatotoxicity; 39 year old man developed jaundice 1-2 years after starting fluoxetine [bilirubin 5.9 mg/dL, ALT 272 U/L, Alk P 153 U/L], resolving within 4-6 months of stopping; 45 year old woman with jaundice arising after 3 months of fluoxetine [bilirubin 6.4 mg/dL, ALT 641 U/L, Alk P 210 U/L], resolving within 2 months of stopping.
730	38 year old woman with acute intermittent porphyria had several premenstral attacks resolving with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue therapy [triptorelin].
731	A series of gallotannin analogs were prepared by chemical synthesis, and their affinity for the test-case protein bovine serum albumin was measured by equilibrium dialysis. The structure/activity data obtained suggest that the naturally occurring gallotannins, in fact, do not represent the optimal protein recognition agents amongst polyphenolated templates. 
732	Quantum therapy was conducted in 29 patients with functional class II-III exertional angina concurrent with a first to second degree obstructive bronchitis presenting with respiratory failure. The control group was formed of 20 patients matched by illness, sex, and age, who received basic therapy. The clinical course of IHD has been shown to be improved, the concomitant pathology alleviated by the therapies applied; there was an improvement in intracardiac and regional pulmonary hemodynamics. 
733	"The study was made in forty subjects, their health level being assessed as recommended by G. L. Apanasenko as well as by modification of his method. The results obtained showed the health level of those enrolled in the study to have gotten increased with administration of Biotrit C and balsam ""Biotrit"" during 20 days. The effect was found out to be maintained for 20 days after the drug had been withdrawn. The obtained results permit recommending Biotrit C and balsam ""Biotrit"" as adaptogens. "
734	It is reported that a C1-inhibitor (CI-INH) deficiency dependent angiodema case arose 'de novo' in a child without a family history of this disease. His mother was undergoing immunosuppressive therapy (50 mg of azathioprine plus 8 mg of methyl-prednisolone daily) during pregnancy, uninterrupted for seven years because of a kidney transplant. All the other known causes of acquired C1-INH deficiency were excluded. An involvement of an azathioprine-induced C1-INH gene mutation is hypothised. 
735	We report the case of a patient with a massive crushing trauma of the right foot who developed a local infection due to Absidia corymbifera. Systemic and local antifungal therapy with ketoconazole associated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) yielded a rapid clinical and microbiological resolution. Controlled clinical studies are warranted to further elucidate the potential utility of HBO/antifungal combination therapy. 
736	43 year old man with chronic hepatitis C developed rise in ALT [260 U/L] 4 weeks after starting interferon which resolved on stopping, but recurred with restarting with jaundice [bilirubin 10-27 mg/dL] and ALT elevation [1038 U/L] and progressing to acute liver failure and liver transplantation.
737	Among 275 patients with familial hyperlipidemia, 3% had ALT elevations and 2 had raised alkaline phosphatase and slight bilirubin elevations during atorvastatin therapy; resolving after switching to fluvastatin.
738	Population based study identified 5 cases of acute liver injury during antifungal therapy in 69,830 patients; relative risk for ketoconazole was 228 [~2:1,000 patients], itraconazole 17.7 [~1:10,000] and terbinafine 4.2 [~.2:10,000].
739	156 patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer were treated with intravenous 5-FU and leucovorin with or without 6 cycles of hepatic arterial infusions of FUDR with dexamethasone; FUDR therapy was associated with better survival, but Alk P elevations >2 times ULN occurred in 29%, AST >3 times ULN in 65%, bilirubin >3 mg/dL in 18%, and fatal sclerosing cholangitis in 2 [3%] patients on FUDR.

797	Negative effects of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ECSWL) were analysed in 101 patients aged 20 to 72 years. Urinary hemoglobin rise was found in all the patients. Protein levels rose if the calculi were located in the kidneys and low ureter. A 5-fold rise in plasma free hemoglobin in any position of the concrement indicates intravascular hemolysis as ECSWL hazards. Thus, ECSWL seems to damage stone-adjacent tissues and induce a general hematological reaction.

The immunoaffinity extract was then automatically introduced to reversed-phase 
799	Examination of 54 patients with duodenal peptic ulcer revealed significant correlations between the psychological traits of the patients and their plasma antioxidative activity in the mild and moderate courses of the disease. There were no correlations in patients with severe duodenal peptic ulcer. A correlation analysis of the correlation between the personality traits and plasma antioxidative activity in patients with peptic ulcer may be used to for its prognosis. 
800	To evaluate the effectivity of granulated sugar in the treatment of irreductable paraphimosis.

807	Analysis of effects of indinavir on UDP glucuronyltransferase activity in vitro and in vivo, showing competitive inhibition by indinavir, but not saquinavir at therapeutic levels; in 15 patients, rise in bilirubin occurred in 13 and was more marked in those with Gilbert's TATA box variants [0.8 rising to 2.3 mg/dL] than without [0.5 rising to 0.8 mg/dL].
808	Artificial pneumoperitoneum (introduction of gas in the peritonea cavity) has been tried for the first time in medical practice, by the Austrian surgeon Mosetig-Moorhof, in January and July 1893. This method was utilized in turns to therapeutic or diagnostic ends, especially in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (collapsotherapy) since 1930 till the advent of isoniazid in 1952. Today, pneumoperitoneum remains an ultimate indication; it is the first step of coelioscopy. 
809	Clinicoendoscopic morphological and morphofunctional studies in 50 patients with chronic cholecystitis and 50 patients with chronic biliary pancreatitis have demonstrated that morphometric analysis of the antral stomach endocrine cells secreting melatonin, neurotensin and somatostatin can be used in addition to standard laboratory and device methods for differentiation chronic biliary pancreatitis with biliary pathology. 
810	Adverse reactions caused by benzodiazepines rarely occur. We present a case of a 70-year-old man who developed a maculopapular exanthema after the ingestion of tetrazepam. For his diagnosis, skin tests were performed, including prick and patch tests, not only with the benzodiazepine implicated in the reaction, but also with benzodiazepines of other groups. Single-blind oral challenge tests were also performed in the patient, in order to assess his tolerance to other benzodiazepines. 
811	Patients with advanced HIV disease have a poor response to some immunizations. A case is presented of a Class C1 HIV-infected child who suffered three episodes of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 6B bacteremia despite having received the heptavalent conjugate and 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines. Clinicians should expect some vaccine failures with the heptavalent conjugate vaccine in children with advanced HIV disease. 
812	"This is the text of a policy statement adopted by the Governing Council of the American Public Health Association on 17 Nov 1982.  The Association commends the efforts of family planning clinics to encourage parental involvement in the decisions of adolescent clients regarding the use of contraceptives, but ""strongly opposes policies requiring parental consent or notification as a qualification of minors for initial or continued receipt of prescription contraceptives."" "
813	A British case of an elderly widow who received an experimental cancer drug without her consent is reported.  The drug led to her death and the case came to public notice.

844	60 year old woman with breast cancer developed fatigue and mild ALT elevations [64 to 98 U/L] during cycles 2 to 4 of methotrexate-fluorouracil-cyclophosphamide, resolving when methotrexate was replaced by mitoxantrone; biopsy showed centrolobular fat and ballooning.
845	"Among 88 patients with severe SOS after HCT treated with defibrotide [5 to 60 mg/kg/day for 1 to 139 days], complete resolution occurred in 36% and therapy was ""without significant toxicity""."
846	45 year old woman developed progressive cholestasis and vanishing bile duct syndrome 2 months after a 6 day course of amoxicillin; progressive cholestasis evolved into chronic liver failure and death 18 months later.
847	Abstract; among 553 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis treated with two 12 week courses of one weekly alefacept or placebo, clinical responses occurred in 28% of alefacept vs 8% of placebo treated subjects and side effects were mild; no mention of ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity.
848	63 year old woman developed jaundice 7 months after starting nimesulide for osteoarthritis [bilirubin 33.9 mg/dL, ALT 143 U/L, Alk P 1099 U/L], which was complicated by severe hemolytic anemia with hepatic failure and death 23 days after admission.
849	Controlled trial of oral gemifloxacin vs iv followed by oral ceftriaxone for 7-14 days in 341 patients with community acquired pneumonia; liver test elevations occurred in 7 [4.1%] gemifloxacin vs 12 [7%] ceftriaxone treated subjects, but no mention of clinically apparent liver injury.
850	Between 1999-2002, 110 patients were treated with pyrazinamide/rifampin [PR] for 2 months, and 114 with isoniazid [INH] for 6 months for latent tuberculosis; completion rates were higher [71% vs 59%] as was hepatotoxicity [13% vs 4%] with PR than INH, and 2 patients had clinically apparent hepatitis [ALT 45-67 times ULN at 4 weeks], but both survived; after intensive monitoring was introduced, there were no further severe cases on PR .
851	Among 37 patients followed prospectively, serum ALT, AST and GGT levels increased during a preliminary 4-7 day course of enoxaparin, but decreased into the normal range when patients were switched to idraparinux.
852	21 year old woman with severe asthma developed ALT elevations [2.5 to 10 times ULN] without jaundice within 3 days of starting montelukast, normalizing within a few weeks of stopping; role of right heart failure and hypoxemia unclear.
853	Among 145 women with metastatic breast cancer treated with bexarotene, clinical responses were uncommon and usually partial, while adverse events included hypertriglyceridemia [84%], dry skin [34%], weakness [30%] and headache [27%] and two patients [1%] had dose limiting liver test elevations.
854	Two cases: 66 year old man developed jaundice 6 weeks after starting ticlopidine [bilirubin 5.4 rising to 19.3 mg/dL, ALT 263 U/L, Alk P 99 U/L, eosinophils 9%], resolving in 6 months [Case 1]; 82 year old man developed jaundice 4 weeks after starting ticlopidine [bilirubin 4.0 mg/dL, ALT 440 U/L, Alk P 660 U/L, eosinophils 12%], resolving within 3 months.
855	32 year old man with fungal meningitis developed ALT elevations 13 days after starting fluconazole which continued to increase despite dose reduction, peaking at ALT 967 U/L, Alk P 132 U/L, but normal bilirubin; switching to voriconazole was followed by fall towards normal.
856	A 44-year-old woman who is a new patient has no known current health problems and no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Eighteen months ago, she had a normal screening mammogram. She recently read that mammograms may not help to prevent death from breast cancer and that “the patient should decide.” But she does not think she knows enough. She worries that there is a breast-cancer epidemic. What should her physician advise?
857	Analysis of 51 candidate genes in 110 patients treated with troglitazone, 25 of whom developed abnormal ALT levels [range 360-1905 U/L]; association found with glutathione-S-transferase polymorphisms [odds ratio 3.7: 40% of cases vs 15% of controls].
858	26 year old pregnant woman with CD4 count of 614 developed rash and fever 6 weeks after starting lamivudine, zidovudine and nevirapine [9.6% eosinophilia, bilirubin 12 mg/dL, ALT 235 U/L, Alk P 257 U/L, INR 2.4], who worsened despite stopping nevirapine and receiving corticosteroids; had emergency Caesarian with subsequent recovery: Case 2.
859	23 year old woman developed fever and nausea during sertraline therapy [bilirubin 2.1 mg/dL, ALT ~850 U/L], resolving upon stopping and recurring [ALT~230 U/L] on restarting for 3 days.
860	All 6 protease inhibitors used for HIV infection have been associated with hepatotoxicity, all are extensively metabolized by the hepatic CYP450 system; overall range of ALT elevations above 5 times ULN is 3% to 18%, but symptomatic liver injury occurs in only 1.5 to 5% of patients; risk factors ALT elevations are HCV, HBV and full dose ritonavir.
861	37 year old man had AST elevations at end of 2 month course of rifampin/pyrazinamide, with levels rising thereafter [bilirubin 7.8 mg/dL, AST 2409 U/L] and need for liver transplant 2 months later.
862	Review and discussion of individual lipid lowering agents; fenofibrate has been associated with both acute and chronic liver injury including cirrhosis; chronic injury often being accompanied by features of autoimmune hepatitis.
863	Review of efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin in doses of up to 80 mg daily in 12,569 patients [14,231 patient years]: ALT elevations >3 times ULN occurred in 0.2% and similar rate in comparators: atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin.
864	Case reported above by FDA of 14 year old girl who developed fulminant hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation after taking a kava containing herbal for 3 months [bilirubin 16.2 mg/dL, ALT 4076, GGT 148 U/L], first report of fatal kava hepatotoxicity in a child.
865	"Four cases of acute ""toxic"" liver injury during mercaptopurine therapy of leukemia in children, ages 4-13 years, arising 2-6 months after starting drug [bilirubin 4.5-8.7 mg/dL, Alk P mildly elevated]."
866	Two cases; 55 and 35 year old men with active tuberculosis developed high fever 15 and 19 days after starting isoniazid and PAS or streptomycin accompanied by mild liver abnormalities [bilirubin 1.8 and 4.0 mg/dL], with rapid resolution and recurrence of fever on subsequent rechallenge.
867	Comparison of regular vs sustained release [SR] niacin found more adverse events and 2 cases of jaundice with SR form; 56 year old man tolerated regular niacin but developed abdominal pain and nausea after 4 days of the same dose of SR niacin [bilirubin 6.4 mg/dL, AST 20 times ULN, Alk P slightly elevated], resolving within 4 weeks of stopping; 51 year old man developed jaundice in first week of SR niacin therapy [bilirubin 3.5 mg/dL, AST 3 times and Alk P 3 times ULN], resolving in 7 weeks.
868	47 year old woman with rheumatoid arthritis developed nausea and jaundice 3 weeks after starting gold therapy with prolonged jaundice and pruritus [bilirubin 7.5 rising to 24 mg/dL, Alk P 2-3 times ULN, ALT 134 U/L, 2% eosinophils on corticosteroids], laparotomy and liver biopsy showing intrahepatic cholestasis.
869	Followed liver tests in 30 patients treated with methandienone; AST elevations occurred in 27% [60-180 U/L], Alk P2 times ULN] and bilirubin [2.0] in 1, and BSP retention in 62%; all without symptoms and resolving rapidly, some without stopping drug.
870	79 year old woman with dementia developed elevated liver enzymes but without symptoms 9 months after starting thioridazine, resolving rapidly with stopping; jaundice was not mentioned in text of the report.
871	Review of 150 cases of copper poisoning seen at a single hospital in New Delhi over a 5 year period treated with gastric lavage, dimercaprol [BAL], fluids, transfusions, sedatives and corticosteroids; patient ages 13 to 60 years, 102 cases were mild and 48 severe; jaundice arising in 19%, circulatory collapse in 7% and death in 24 [16%].
872	75 year old man developed jaundice 10 days after starting chlorpropamide [bilirubin 14.2 mg/dL, ALT 30 U/L, Alk P 2.5 times ULN], resolving within 2 months of stopping.
873	38 year old woman developed rash, jaundice and pruritus ~4 weeks after starting methimazole [bilirubin 6.2 mg/dL, ALT 545 U/L, Alk P ~2 times ULN, 12% eosinophils], slowly resolving on stopping therapy.
874	Experiments on the rat indicate that intravenous administration of indium chloride produces severe hepatic necroses with fatal icterus within a few days. These actions can be prevented by the prophylactic administration of ferric dextran. This protective effect of the iron compound must be largely specific since it could not be duplicated by pretreatment with any of a large series of other agents. The possible mechanism of the protective effect is briefly discussed. 
875	Serum cholesterol levels decreased with the stress of operation, before the procedure or after it, or before and after. This decrease was 17.6 per cent in a group of 28 elective surgery patients and 20.4 per cent in nine ruptured intervertebral disc patients who had an operation. A presurgical drop was noted and considered to be related to psychological stress. 
876	The deposition of liver glycogen in starved rats given a single dose of cortisone is inhibited by puromycin and actinomycin. The former agent interferes with induced enzyme formation in general, and the latter with the cortisone-induced rise in liver enzyme levels. The results suggest that the regulatory eJffect of cortisone on carbohydrate metabolism may be brought about -by its action on the cellular concentration of certain enzyme proteins. 
877	54 year old man developed jaundice two months after starting intermittent chloramphenicol for urinary tract infections [bilirubin 19 mg/dL, ALT 305 U/L, Alk P 2.3 times ULN], with subsequent pancytopenia and death from sepsis.
878	A fatal case of agranulocytosis due to chlorpromazine is reported. Mechanisms other than immunological are generally believed to be responsible for chlorpromazine-induced agranulocytosis. However, the demonstration of a drug-specific leuco-agglutinin in the serum of this patient suggests that an immunological mechanism was responsible for the agranulocytosis. 
879	A single injection into the rat of chlorpromazine, reserpine, benactyzine or phenobarbitone stimulates the release of corticotrophin. This effect is not seen after the drugs have been injected daily for 5 days, nor when the rats are hypophysectomized or pretreated with hydrocortisone. The stimulant effect of ether on corticotrophin release is not modified by pretreatment with a single injection, nor to any great extent after 5 daily injections of these drugs. 
880	Analysis of hepatotoxicity in 40 patients with tuberculosis treated with ethionamide for 4 to 14 months [750 mg daily] in various combinations; 3 patients had BSP elevations, but ALT and AST were normal or minimally elevated and none developed jaundice or Alk P elevations.
881	Description of 4 patients with jaundice and hyperthyroidism with congestive heart failure, but not on therapy and with no other known cause of liver disease [bilirubin 1.3-6.4 mg/dL, Alk P 1-3 times ULN, AST 13-40 U/L], jaundice resolving with successful therapy of hyperthyroidism.
882	Retrospective analysis of 26 patients with embryonic cell cancers treated with plicamycin found dramatic responses in a few patients, but therapy was limited by toxicities, largely to the bone marrow, no mention of hepatotoxicity.
883	Among 300 women treated with Lyndiol OCCs, none developed jaundice; prospective study in 50 patients treated for 14 to 43 months found no confirmed abnormalities of liver tests.
884	Two Japanese women with tuberculosis, ages 34 and 57 years, developed acute liver failure after 1.5 and 7 months of ethionamide therapy, whose autopsies showed massive necrosis; among 50 patients studied prospectively, 36% were said to develop abnormal liver tests, based on serial BSP, icterus index and cephalin-flocculation.
885	61 year old man developed anaphylaxis after single dose of colchicine-probenecid with leukemoid reaction, hypotension and fever, recovering within a week; rechallenge with probenecid without colchicine resulted in recurrence of anaphylaxis [bilirubin not given, AST 80 U/L].
886	Many forms of therapy have been tried for aphthous stomatitis in the past without success. The effect of hydrocortisone was tested because of its anti-inflammatory and antiallergic action. Little benefit was derived from such therapy in a series of 26 patients as far as healing time was concerned but many were noticeably relieved of pain. 
887	52 year old man developed nausea 10 days after starting chlorpromazine followed by with fever and jaundice [bilirubin 3.8 mg/dL, Alk P 1.5 times ULN, 49% eosinophilia], resolving slowly over several months after stopping.
888	36 year old woman developed jaundice and pruritus 1 month after starting methimazole [bilirubin 18 m/dL, Alk P 3 times ULN, AST 400 U/L, protime 18 sec]; she delayed in stopping methimazole and jaundice persisted for 10 weeks.
889	45 year old woman with HIV infection treated with diadanosine and stavudine developed jaundice and hepatomegaly 8 weeks after switching from nevirapine to tenofovir [bilirubin 12.6 mg/dL, ALT 157 U/L, CT showed fatty liver], despite stopping antivirals and medical support lactic acidosis worsened and she died 36 hours later: Case 1.
890	Among 339 patients with rheumatoid arthritis not responding adequately to methotrexate who were treated with 1 of 2 doses of abatacept or placebo for six months, response rates were 60% with higher doses of abatacept, 42% with lower doses, and 35% with placebo, while rates of adverse events were similar and no serious adverse event was attributed to drug; no mention of ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity.
891	50 year old developed fatigue 2 months after starting ketoconazole [bilirubin 6.0 rising to 19.9 mg/dL, ALT 1326 U/L, Alk P 165 U/L, prothrombin time 13.3 seconds], resolving spontaneously starting 4 days after stopping; recurrence after 2 days of reexposure [bilirubin 4.9 mg/dL, ALT 1375 U/L, eosinophils 2%].
892	Review of the toxicities and side effects of antimalarials; quinine can cause a characteristic hypersensitivity reaction with liver injury; chloroquine can cause worsening of acute porphyria; sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is associated with clinically apparent liver injury similar to that of sulfonamides; mefloquine can cause transient ALT elevations and rarely hepatitis; atovaquone/proguanil can cause minor ALT elevations; quinine can cause a characteristic hypersensitivity reaction with liver injury; amodiaquine is linked to agranulocytosis and hepatitis in 1:2000 recipients; artemisinin derivatives are associated with ALT elevations in 0.9% and has been linked to rare cases of severe hepatitis; primaquine can cause hemolysis, but has not been linked to cases of hepatitis.
893	"Among 16 patients with psoriasis treated with infliximab, 3 developed asymptomatic ALT elevations [141, 434 and 150 U/L], leading to early discontinuation; all resolved rapidly, 2 were on methotrexate."
894	30 year old woman with chronic hepatitis B developed ALT elevations [689 U/L] without jaundice 2 months after stopping interferon and 6 weeks after starting venlafaxine, resolving in 6 weeks; unclear whether hepatotoxicity or posttreatment flare of hepatitis B.
895	Among 11 patients with transfusion dependent PNH treated with eculizumab, transfusion requirements, episodes of hemolysis and LDH levels decreased and quality of life improved; no adverse events were attributed to therapy except for rare infusion reactions.
896	Initial report in adults: 44 year old woman taking 600,000 IU of vitamin A daily for 18 months presented with alopecia, amenorrhea, bone pains, and cheilosis; no discussion of liver injury.
897	Analysis of 121 biopsies from 66 patients with psoriasis treated with methotrexate for average of 5.4 years found advanced fibrosis arose in 2.6% of biopsies after 1.4-3 g, 8.2% after 4.5-6 g, and 32% after 10 g total dose; total number of cases uncertain; Roenigk score has less helpful than Ishak or Scheuer fibrosis scales.
898	39 year old woman with metastatic colon cancer and emaciation treated with oral testosterone was found to have peliosis hepatis on autopsy, without endothelial lining and with hepatic necrosis.
899	69 year old man with CLL and anti-HBc without HBsAg in serum developed reactivation of hepatitis B after chemotherapy with CHOP, rituximab and fludarabine that responded to lamivudine therapy and did not worsen when he was subsequently treated with alemtuzumab.
900	Concise review of the medical management of intermittent claudication mentions that pentoxifylline is approved for symptomatic therapy of this condition, but that its efficacy is controversial; no mention of ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity.
901	Review of issue of mitochondrial [mt] toxicity of nucleoside analogues in antiretroviral therapy; random testing for venous lactate levels identifies some patients with symptoms of mt toxicity, but does not predict severe lactic acidosis; mtDNA to nuclear DNA ratios in peripheral blood mononuclear cells correlates with hyperlactaemia and mt toxicity; ratios were lower in HIV-infected and in stavudine-treated subjects.
902	35 year old man with AIDS developed jaundice 17 months after starting lopinavir, stavudine and lamivudine [bilirubin 12.5 mg/dL, ALT 200 U/L, Alk P 435 rising to 958 U/L], resolving in 2 months after substituting nelfinavir for lopinavir.
903	Studies have ascertained the high dissemination of the soil with helminthic eggs and cysts of intestinal pathogenic protozoa (Lamblia, Toxoplasma, etc.) in some districts of the Belgorod Region. Comparing these data with the morbidity rates in pregnant females with toxoplasmosis shows a direct high correlation of the above indicators. The latter makes it possible to recommend the helminthic indicators of soil contamination to be used to determine the rate of toxoplasmosis in pregnant females. 
904	Vitamin E has been touted as a panacea for age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease and, thus, the demand for this nutraceutical has increased dramatically in recent years. This demand has, in turn, driven research to increase vitamin E production from plant sources. We have summarized the cumulative work of several groups in this area, describing the current status of efforts to bioengineer plants for elevated vitamin E content. 
905	Synthesis and adenosine deaminase (ADA) inhibitory activity of two analogues of coformycin, containing the imidazo[4,5-e][1,2,4]triazepine ring system, have been reported as part of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies to explore the factors responsible for the extremely tight-binding characteristics of coformycins to ADA. 
906	In analogy with maribavir [1-(beta-L-ribofuranosyl)-isopropylamino-5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole], a nucleoside analogue that acts against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) by a non-nucleoside mechanism, here I present three other examples of classes of nucleoside analogues (i.e. bicyclic furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine as well as HEPT and TSAO derivatives) that act against either HCMV or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through a non-nucleoside mode of action. 
907	Hemoptysis is an important symptom in clinical practice. The diagnosis of the underlying cause is often difficult, particularly in patients presenting with a normal chest x-ray. We report a case of hemoptysis with a normal chest x-ray due to a rare endobronchial neoplasm: myofibroblastic sarcoma. 
908	Adrenocortical carcinomas frequently hypersecrete multiple adrenocortical steroids and their precursors. CT scan and MRI usually demonstrate necrotic lesions or areas of calcification in this uncommon tumor. Therapy in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma is less satisfactory. Surgical excision is the primary mode of therapy. Up to the present, mitotane (o, p'-DDD) treatment combined with chemotherapy has been the only palliative measure for patients with nonresectable or extensively recurrent tumors. 
909	There is no consensus as to the best diagnostic strategy for chronic cough. Many protocols combine empirical trials of treatment with laboratory investigations. More precise diagnostic tools and improved therapeutic options are required. Until then, the management of chronic cough will remain a clinical challenge. 
910	A case of chronic paranasal sinuses with recurrent polyposis caused by miscellaneous infection--fungal (Aspergillus, Candida) and bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter, Streptococcus) is described. The patient underwent 5 times surgical treatment (polypectomies, sinus operations). Good result was achieved after 2-years application of itraconazole and local Amphotericin B. 
911	The homeostasis model assessment enabled us to evaluate insulin resistance easily and accurately in the clinical setting. The restenosis rate of coronary stenting was significantly higher among patients with high values for the homeostasis model assessment. Our findings suggest that insulin resistance measured by the homeostasis model assessment predicts restenosis after coronary stent placement in nondiabetic patients. 
912	Epibatidine is a potent but nonselective nAChR agonist. Its biological effects appear to be mediated largely by alpha4beta2 nAChRs. Surprisingly, only a limited number of epibatidine analogues have been synthesized and evaluated in in vitro assays. Even fewer analogues have received in vivo pharmacological evaluation. In this paper, SAR studies directed toward epibatidine analogues will be reviewed. 
913	Previous work has shown that the crude venom of Parawixia bistriata induces convulsive seizures in rats after intracerebroventricular injection. In this work, the isolation of a bioactive fraction with ultraviolet absorption characteristics of nucleic acid and trace protein or amino acid content is described. NMR analysis demonstrated that the major component of the active fraction is the nucleoside inosine. An analogue of this component (inosine 5'-monophosphate) induced a delayed paralysis effect in termites. 
914	Compounds containing an ethylenediamine structure in place of the piperazine ring of M55113 (1) and M55551 (2) were synthesized to investigate the effects of a piperazine moiety and evaluated for activity as factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors. Most such compounds, however, exhibited lower activity (1/10-1/100) than that of M55113 and M55551 as FXa inhibitors. 
915	The diagnosis of cerebral relapse of Whipple's disease in a 67-year-old patient was made after he presented with somnolence and severe hypothermia 4 months after discontinuing treatment with cotrimoxazole. Hypothermia is a rare hypothalamic manifestation of cerebral Whipple's disease. 
916	Dr Steven F. Harwin, Surgical Director of The New York Center for Bloodless Medicine and Surgery at the Beth Israel Medical Center, shares his expertise on blood conservation in total joint arthroplasty. Initially launched in 1997, The New York Center for Bloodless Medicine and Surgery is the first comprehensive clinical program of its kind in New York City. 
917	We report a 15 yr-old girl who 10 yr post-cardiac transplantation presented with severe growth failure and delayed onset of puberty. She was found to have pan-enteric Crohn's disease and has done remarkably well on principally nutritional therapy with a significant growth spurt and the onset of menarche. The development of bowel disease whilst on immunosuppression is rare and the literature is reviewed. 
918	A patient with chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome positive CML, developed severe protracted bone marrow hypoplasia after interferon therapy. This complication did not respond to two courses of immunosuppressive therapy with anti-thymocyte globulin, cyclosporin A and prednisone. The patient continued to be transfusion dependent with persistence of Philadelphia chromosome. Allogeneic BMT restored normal hematopoeisis. 
919	The amount of literature on amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (APT) peaked in 1983-1984 with several hundred cases reported cumulatively, and declined thereafter. Since the mid-1990s, publications have increased, which suggests that APT remains a current problem in clinical practice. Amiodarone remains difficult to diagnose noninvasively, and although the outcome is good in the majority of patients, not all cases of APT can be controlled satisfactorily. 
920	Human behaviours and consumer products may affect vaginal microbial ecology, thereby influencing women's health. Relevant experimentation systems are needed to understand such possible links. Here, we describe the development of a practical semi-solid in vitro model to assess the effects of interactions between vaginal environment and the presence of tampons, on bacterial communities, including the production of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) by Staphylococcus aureus. 
921	- Between 1983 and 1992 a total of 55 patients suffering from prostate cancer were treated with pions (pi-mesons) at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland. This form of therapy was used at only three centers world wide on 245 patients with 
922	A rapid and inexpensive test has been developed to investigate the influence of elevated heavy metal concentrations on the degradation of biodegradable plastics. Using an overlay agar technique it could be demonstrated that copper concentrations above 8 to 14 mg/L inhibit the degradation of powdered poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), (PHB), by Acidovorax delafieldii. This is the first study demonstrating the inhibiting influence of metals on the biodegradation of PHB. 
923	The authors represented the data of treatment for CIN with Nd YAG laser by 266 women Two laser methods was use--direct by 93 women and indirect by 173. The effect of treatment with direct Nd YAG laser application for all cervieaf lesions ist 100%. There was no one patients with relapse by use the second method the effect ist for 92 to 96.7%. The persistence of lesion ist 3 to 7%, and relapse--3%. 
924	Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a rare cause of endocarditis. Most cases were observed in people working with animals. We report a case in a 45-year old man without any exposure to animals. He was admitted to our hospital because of dyspnoea. Blood cultures were drawn following fever on day 8 of hospitalisation. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was cultured and echocardiography showed a vegetation on the mitral valve. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and surgical treatment led to a good outcome of the infection. 
925	The present report highlights an unusual presentation of vitamin B12 deficiency--recurrent seizures in a 26-year-old man. His symptoms responded to parenteral vitamin B12 therapy. The relevant literature is reviewed. 
926	"Seat belts have dramatically reduced the severity of traumas in car accidents. On the other hand, specific lesions have appeared, related to seat belt use. These lesions are defined as ""seat belt syndrome"". The Authors describe an intestinal medio-ileal perforation due to seat belts in a child. "
927	Chryseomonas luteola has only rarely been reported as a human bacterial pathogen. It has been shown that this organism in particular affects patients with health or indwelling disorders. Most reported cases showed septicemia, meningitis, endocarditis, or peritonitis. Two C. luteola infections observed in Morocco are described in the present study. 
928	Experience of hepatic resection in 93 patients, performed for hemangioma is presented. Anatomic hepatic resection was done in 54 (58.1%) of patients, atypical one--in 22 (23.6%), enucleation of hemangioma--in 17 (18.3%). The least intraoperative blood loss was noted in enucleation of hemangioma and the most--in atypical hepatic resection. Complications had occurred in 15 (16.1%) patients, postoperative mortality was 1.1%. 
929	This paper is the report of a meeting held in Geneva under the auspices of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) on 4-5 June 1996. It contains definitions of terms used in reporting adverse drug reactions of the system/organ class renal and urinary system disorders and basic requirements for their use. 
930	85 year old with congestive heart failure on long term omeprazole developed fatigue and worsening liver tests, [bilirubin 2.0 mg/dL, ALT 263 rising to 1236 U/L, LDH 870 to 2100 U/L, Alk P 112 U/L], improving on stopping and with mild recurrence on restarting [ALT 500 U/L], patient dying 10 days later of acute myocardial infarction and heart failure.
931	This paper is the report of a meeting held in Geneva under the auspices of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) on 5-6 November 1997. It contains definitions of terms, and basic requirements for their use, for purposes of reporting adverse drug reactions of the system/organ classes: cardiovascular disorders, general; heart rate and rhythm disorders; and vascular (extracardiac) disorders. 
932	Cross sectional analysis of factors associated with hepatic fibrosis among 152 of 559 patients with HIV-HCV coinfection undergoing liver biopsy; advanced fibrosis was more common with higher age of infection, use of protease inhibitors and nevirapine based therapy.
933	Coeliac disease has been associated with a variety of neurological conditions, most frequently cerebellar ataxia and peripheral neuropathy. To date, chorea has not been associated with coeliac disease. We present the case histories of 4 individuals with coeliac disease and chorea (4 women, average age of onset of chorea 61 years). Unexpectedly, most of these patients showed a notable improvement in their motor symptoms after the introduction of a gluten-free diet. 
934	Electro-chemical oxidation as a method to destroy drug residues like aspirin, tetracycline or gentamicine in water was investigated with C-anodes (modified by manganese oxides) and Pt anodes. The mechanism of aspirin and tetracycline oxidation and the influence of the biocide effect was observed using GC-MS and three different microbiological tests. In general, the biological availability increases with progressive oxidation of the antibiotics. 
935	A lectin from Vatairea macrocarpa (Vmac) seeds was investigated in a model of paw edema in rats and the possible involvement of leukocytes. Vmac (200 and 400 microg/paw, s.c.) induced a significant time- and dose-dependent paw edema, with leukocyte infiltration, which was drastically reduced in leukopaenic animals. These data suggest a pro-inflammatory effect for this lectin that is dependent on the presence of leukocytes. 
936	In rats with a hemodynamic disorder caused by acute myocardial ischemia, preliminary administration of beditin in a dose of 25 mg/kg fully prevents a manifold increase in the level of 45Ca2+ in the cytosol of brain cells and leads to enhanced trapping and accumulation of labeled calcium in endoplasmic reticulum. With respect to calcium binding in endoplasmic reticulum, the action of beditin substantially differs from that of verapamil. 
937	Fluoro-DHCeA (4) was efficiently synthesized from d-cyclopentenone derivative 5 using electrophilic fluorination as a key step. Fluoro-DHCeA (4) was found to be as potent as DHCeA (3), but exhibited irreversible inhibition of enzyme unlike DHCeA (3) showing reversible inhibition. From this study, 4(')-hydroxymethyl groups of neplanocin A and fluoro-neplanocin A played an important role in binding to the active site of the enzyme. 
938	Complementary and alternative medicine has become an important section of healthcare. Its high level of acceptance among the general population represents a challenge to healthcare professionals of all disciplines and raises a host of ethical issues. This article is an attempt to explore some of the more obvious or practical ethical aspects of complementary and alternative medicine. 
939	Among 60 patients with thrombocythemia due to myeloproliferative diseases treated with anagrelide [0.5 to 5 mg daily] for 2 years, response rates were 67%, and side effects included palpitations [70%], headache [52%], nausea [35%], diarrhea [33%], edema [22%] and fatigue [23%]; no mention of ALT elevations and no reported hepatic severe adverse events.
940	In 13 controlled trials with 49,275 patients with routine liver test monitoring for an average of 3.6 years, statin therapy was not associated with increased rate of liver test abnormalities [1.14% vs 1.05%: odds ratio = 1.26; 95% CI = 0.99-1.62] compared to placebo. 
941	Among 813 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin [FOLFIRI] with or without bevacizumab, patient survival was longer with bevacizumab, but adverse events were similar in the two groups; no mention of ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity.
942	Bioassay directed fractionation of a Raspailia (Raspailia) sp. (Order Poecilosclerida; Family Raspailiidae) collected during scientific trawling operations off the Northern Rottnest Shelf yielded as nematocidal agents the known metabolites, phorboxazoles A (1) and B (2). Further examination revealed the new natural product but known synthetic compound, esmodil (3). The structure for 3 was confirmed by spectroscopic analysis and total synthesis. 
943	An ultrasound examination of the thorax of three horses which were performing poorly or had mild signs of colic showed that they had a cranial mediastinal mass and a pleural effusion. A cytological examination of the pleural fluid showed that it did not contain neoplastic cells. A histological examination of an ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the cranial mediastinal mass showed that in each of the three horses it was a lymphosarcoma. 
944	We evaluated the effect of the combination of micafungin and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) against hyphae of Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis. Micafungin enhanced the PMN oxidative burst dose dependently. The combination was synergistic (C. albicans) or additive (C. dubliniensis); when PMN were pretreated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, the combination was more effective. 
945	Rhesus and human cytomegalovirus (RhCMV and HCMV, respectively) exhibit comparable inhibition by benzimidazole nucleosides, including 2,5,6-trichloro-(1-beta-d-ribofuranosyl)benzimidazole (TCRB), and pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines. The two HCMV protein targets of TCRB, UL89 and UL56, are highly conserved with their RhCMV homologues. These data indicate that infection of rhesus macaques with RhCMV represents a useful model to test novel anti-HCMV drugs. 
946	In January 2004, four people living with HIV/AIDS from Shuangmiao village, Henan Province, China, went public with complaints about the conduct of a medical experiment, raising questions about whether research subjects gave their informed consent to participate in the experiment. The complaints and questions were contained in a letter to the Ethics Review Panel of the Center for STD/AIDS Prevention and Control at the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control. 
947	A bioassay-guided investigation of Gustavia hexapetala led to the isolation of a new cancer cell growth inhibitor designated gustastatin (1) and four previously known cancer cell growth inhibitors that included betulinic acid (2). The structures were assigned on the basis of analyses of HRMS combined with 1D and 2D NMR data. The structure of portentol (5) was confirmed by an X-ray crystal structure determination. 
948	Hairy roots of the Chinese herb, Pueraria phaseoloides, obtained from leaf explants and transformed with the Agrobacterium rhizogenes, were cultured in 2.5 l airlift bioreactors for three weeks. Puerarin accumulated at 5,570 microg g(-1) dry wt, which is near 200 times as much as in 250 ml flask cultures. In addition, puearin was exuded into the nutrient medium at final concentrations higher than in the hairy roots themselves. 
949	Acetylhomotaurine was labeled with (11)C via N-acetylation with [(11)C]acetyl chloride. The synthesis yielded 48.2+/-3.8%, decay corrected to end of bombardment. The specific activity of the (radio)chemically pure product was 20.8+/-2.0 GBq/micromol at EOS. In vivo studies revealed a very fast clearance of the tracer from the blood and a uniform distribution in the different brain regions. Unfortunately, the poor passage through the blood brain barrier makes the tracer not suitable for PET studies. 
950	This study assessed the treatment with boron neutron capture synovectomy of synovitis in the antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) model. A boron compound, potassium dodecahydrododeca-borate (K(2)B(12)H(12)), was injected into stifle joints of 24 AIA and 12 normal rabbits and activated by neutron bombardment of the joint to achieve doses from 800 to 81,000 RBE-cGy. Synovial ablation in the AIA joint was accomplished at doses of 6,000 to 7,000 RBE-cGy with no adverse effects to skin or extracapsular tissues. 
951	Valvular heart disease is a rare complication of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), with most cases associated with polyarticular JRA. The aortic valve is most commonly affected, and valvular involvement occurs months or years after the onset of JRA. Reported cases of valvular heart disease in patients with JRA in a pauciarticular pattern are rare. We report a case of severe aortic insufficiency in a 12-year-old boy who underwent aortic valve replacement before diagnosis of JRA with a pauciarticular pattern. 
952	The prevalence of hypertension is very high in diabetic patients. Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and microangiopathic complications. In diabetic patients the therapeutic goal is to lower blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg. Improving lifestyle contributes to reducing body weight and blood pressure and often permits to reduce the quantity of antihypertensive drugs necessary to reach this goal. 
953	Cervical pregnancy is a rare condition, constituting <1% of all ectopic pregnancies. We report here, the successful management of a viable 7 weeks gestation cervical pregnancy. Feticide with 2 ml of potassium chloride 15% was performed under the guidance of transvaginal ultrasonography. Then 70 mg methotrexate (50 mg/m(2)) was injected through this spinal needle in to the amniotic cavity. Also serial changes in the color Doppler imaging after the methotrexate injection were emphasized. 
954	Among 270 recently abstinent alcohol dependent subjects treated with one of 3 doses of nalmefene or placebo for 12 weeks, side effects of nausea, dry mouth, insomnia, dizziness and confusion were more common in nalmefene treated patients; no mention of ALT and AST results.
955	The HIV-1 plague continues unabatedly across sub-Saharan Africa. In Botswana and Swaziland, nearly 40% of the entire adult population is already infected. No current program is capable of slowing the advancing tide. An effective vaccine and widespread treatment are years, if not, decades away. In this most urgent situation, I propose that pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis be studied as a means to reduce the spread of HIV-1 among at-risk individuals. 
956	Antibiotic prophylaxis is widely used in surgery for hip fractures. In a retrospective study of case notes of 100 patients, frequent inaccuracies in dose administration were observed. This was applicable to both the pre-operative and the postoperative doses. Longer time intervals between the doses, failure to administer the prescribed doses, and failure of proper documentation were observed. Improvement in the awareness of staff and timely administration of prophylactic antibiotic has resulted from this study. 
957	To improve specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, neuropsychological tests and fluorine-18-FDG-PET are increasingly used. Here we present a patient whose lithium intoxication mimicked Alzheimer's disease both clinically and in 18-FDG-PET. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of the differential diagnosis of dementias and is intended to highlight one potential pitfall. 
958	Nonimmune hypersensitivity reactions are unpredictable adverse drug reactions that are clinically similar to allergic reactions for which no drug-specific antibodies or T lymphocytes are identified. Few tools allow a definite diagnosis, and most of the available ones need to be validated. True epidemiologic data are limited, and most of the available information on the incidence, mortality, and socioeconomic impact should be discussed with caution. 
959	A test using monoclonal antibodies for detection of antigen in stool samples was compared with culture and histology for noninfected (n = 25), Helicobacter pylori-infected (n = 25), and Helicobacter felis-infected (n = 6) mice. Sensitivity and specificity were 96%. The monoclonal antibody-based test is therefore a noninvasive technique that is able to diagnose H. pylori infection in mice. 
960	27 year old developed acute hepatitis 3 days after starting amoxicillin [bilirubin 7.9 mg/dL, ALT 84 times, Alk P normal], resolving within 1 month; patient also took acetaminophen.
961	81 year old man developed nausea and jaundice 4 weeks after starting chlorpropamide [bilirubin 15.2 mg/dL, ALT 255 U/L, Alk P 902 U/L], with subsequent multiorgan failure and death.
962	Among 50 patients with severe psoriasis treated with bexarotene in 4 doses for 12-24 weeks, clinical responses occurred in 22-52% of patients and adverse events included hypertriglyceridemia [56%], decrease in serum free T4 levels [54%], fatigue [14%], pruritus [14%] and ALT elevations [6%].
963	82 year old man with prostate cancer developed jaundice 2-3 months after starting flutamide and leuprolide [bilirubin 13.6 mg/dL, ALT 1369 U/L, GGT 586 U/L], with rapid recovery upon stopping.
964	39 year old man developed oral ulcers within 2 weeks of starting nevirapine, progressing to Stevens-Johnson syndrome and severe hepatitis, with rapid improvement after IVIG and N-acetylcysteine therapy; few details provided.
965	10 year old girl developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome after 2 days of ibuprofen for fever [initial bilirubin 5.4 mg/dL, ALT 639 U/L, Alk P 2 times ULN], followed by prolonged jaundice and vanishing bile duct syndrome but ultimate recovery.
966	Among 3 patients with hepatitis B and Crohn disease, 2 developed a severe flare of hepatitis B after 2-3 months of infliximab therapy; the patient who did not suffer reactivation was being treated with lamivudine.
967	74 year old woman developed jaundice 2 months after starting rofecoxib [bilirubin 12.0 rising to 29 mg/dL, ALT 31 U/L, Alk P 2968 U/L], with bloody diarrhea and acute renal failure, ultimately resolving on prednisone, but Alk P elevations were still present 2 years later.
968	Early nodular regenerative hyperplasia found in 20 of 39 [53%] biopsies done in evaluation of abnormal liver tests in patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving 6-thioguanine; often required reticulin staining to demonstrate.
969	Treatment regimens for both substance abuse and hepatitis C infection are complex and evolving. New pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction allows for office-based treatment and, thus, an opportunity for expanded treatment in the context of hepatitis C infection. The current article addresses the newly evolving, complex issues in the medical management of hepatitis C and injection drug use.
970	Detailed reanalysis of results of randomized controlled trial comparing 12 months of isoniazid [INH] to 2 months of rifampin/pyrazinamide [RP] for latent tuberculosis in HIV infected patients; comparing INH to RP recipients, bilirubin >2.5 mg/dL occurred in 0.6% vs 1.8% and AST >250 U/L in 1.6% vs 2.1%, and no hospitalizations or deaths due to hepatotoxicity; older age only risk factor identified.
971	A 27-year-old man with the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and a large-B-cell lymphoma had heterozygous mutations in the Fas and perforin (Prf1) genes. The Fas mutation was inherited from his healthy father and was also carried by his healthy brother, whereas the Prf1 mutation was inherited from his healthy mother. The combined effect of the two mutant genes may have contributed to the development of the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and lymphoma in this patient.
972	Systematic review of published literature on association of androgen therpay and liver tumors identified 133 cases, 36 in patients with Fanconi’s anemia, others with aplastic anemia, endocrine and gynecological disorders and body builders; most due to oxymetholone, metyltestosterone and danazol, but 6 associated with intramuscular testosterone injections; hepatocellular carcinoma 53%, adenomas 37%, others included cholangiocarcinoma and angiosarcoma.
973	64 year old woman with CML developed ALT elevations 2 months after starting imatinib, with recurrence on restarting [bilirubin 5.7 mg/dL, ALT 28 times ULN, Alk P 3 times ULN], resolving in 3 months and recurring 2 weeks after restarting again.
974	60 year old with gastrointestinal stromal tumors on imatinib therapy developed facial edema and Stevens Johnson syndrome 10 days after starting lansoprazole for dyspepsia; she recovered upon stopping, but rash recurred when patient restarted both medications 2 months later.
975	Monitoring liver enzymes in 89 children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis at monthly intervals for an average of 3 years, identified 13 instances [15%] of ALT or AST elevations >2 times ULN, all resolved rapidly and methotrexate was either continued or restarted without recurrence.
976	Among 4011 women with high risk of breast cancer treated with raloxifene or placebo for up to 8 years, total as well as serious adverse events and discontinuations because of adverse events were similar in the two groups; no mention of ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity.
977	Ten year experience of 96 patients with acute liver injury, 64 due to viral hepatitis and 32 to drugs; major agents identified being amiodarone, augmentin, minocycline and nitrofurantoin. Trovafloxacin accounted for 1 case which was symptomatic but anicteric, resolving within 6 weeks of stopping.
978	Among 673 patients with rheumatic diseases treated with methotrexate between 1986 and 1999, 74% continued on therapy for 5 years or more; 37 patients stopped because of abnormal liver tests; 25 patients died, but none from liver disease.
979	81 year old woman developed severe hepatocellular injury 6 days after desflurane anesthesia [bilirubin 6.9 rising to 12.5 mg/dL, ALT 2188 U/L, Alk P 149 U/L], with ultimate full recovery.  Case 1.
980	Among 107 patients with HIV-HCV coinfection with liver histology, 27 [25%: 5 events per 100 patient years] had ALT elevations >5 times ULN or >3.5 times baseline; more frequent in patients with higher levels of fibrosis [38% vs 15%], also higher in patients receiving nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
981	In a prospective study, ALT elevations above 5 times normal occurred in 17% [66/385] of nevirapine vs 0% [0/83] of efavirenz treated patients, usually in the first 12 weeks, most had symptoms including rash, nausea and jaundice; two cases of acute liver failure and death on nevirapine.
982	68 year old man with advanced refractory multiple myeloma developed septic shock on the 6th day of cycle 1 of therapy, with subsequent increase in liver enzymes [ALT 2865 U/L, LDH 6448 U/L] followed by rapid recovery, but recurrence with two subsequent cycles [peak bilirubin 2.8 mg/dL, ALT 2750 U/L, LDH 6129 U/L] and rapid recovery each time.
983	52 year old man with hepatitis C and osteomyelitis developed rash on vancomycin, was switched to daptomycin and 9 days later developed muscle weakness [CK 20,771 U/L, ALT 48 U/L, AST 239 U/L, Alk P 118 U/L] without jaundice, enzymes falling to normal within 2 weeks of stopping.
984	Controlled trial of 10 mg or 80 mg of atorvastatin daily in 10,001 patients with coronary artery disease and LDL cholesterol of <130 mg/dL for an average of 4.9 years; rate of confirmed ALT elevation >3 times ULN 1.2% with high dose and 0.2% with low dose atorvastatin; 5 cases of rhabdomyolysis, but no hepatitis reported.
985	Controlled trial of temozolomide and radiation vs radiation alone in 573 patients with glioblastoma showing increase in 2 year survival [26% vs 10%]; severe side effects included bone marrow suppression, fatigue, thromboembolism and infections; no mention of hepatotoxicity, jaundice or ALT elevations.
986	Elderly man with severe methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection developed rising lactate 2.0?12.5 ?mol/L over 7 days of linezolid therapy, resolved with discontinuation, no evidence of liver injury.
987	"Controlled trial of adding etanercept to interferon and ribavirin therapy of chronic hepatitis C found similar rates of sustained response [32% vs 42%] and no evidence of worsening of hepatitis during etanercept therapy."
988	Analysis of 2 month course of rifampin and pyrazinamide in jail and homeless populations found ALT elevations >5 times ULN in 6% of patients one of whom died of acute liver failure; risk factors were older age and baseline ALT levels.
989	"35 year old woman with HBsAg [normal ALT levels and no HBeAg] and ankylosing spondylitis developed rising levels of HBV DNA followed by ALT elevations after starting infliximab therapy and improved on lamivudine therapy."
990	Review of the chemical structure, absorption, antibacterial activity and clinical efficacy and safety of rifaximin; when given orally it is nontoxic in experimental animals, and few adverse events have been reported in humans, most common being flatulence, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain with rare cases of allergic rash, but no hepatotoxicity even in post-marketing studies.
991	17 year old boy with sickle cell disease and severe hemolytic anemia given ceftriaxone developed progressive renal and hepatic failure and death; liver failuire likely due to shock.
992	32 year old man developed jaundice a few weeks after starting an unknown Chinese herbal medication [bilirubin 24.5 mg/dL, ALT 2650 U/L, GGT 73 U/L], resolving within 8 weeks of stopping.
993	60 year old man with HIV infection developed fatal lactic acidosis and aminotransferase elevations 5 months after being switched from stavudine to abacavir while continuing tenofovir and nevirapine [ALT 70 U/L, lactate 9.7 mmol], and progressive acidosis.
994	Among patients undergoing hepatic resections for colorectal cancer metastases, steatohepatitis and liver injury were more common among the 14 who received oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan than 10 who received 5-FU alone or 13 given no chemotherapy.
995	52 year old woman developed jaundice, acute liver failure, lactic acidosis, and phosphate loosing nephropathy after ingesting herbal tea made from senna fruits for 3 years [bilirubin 6.2 mg/dL, ALT 9160 U/L, INR 5.3], requiring temporary ventilator support, ultimately resolving.
996	Among 669 patients with refractory multiple myeloma treated with multiple cycles of bortezomib or dexamethasone, response rates and survival were greater with bortezomib; common side effects were diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, constipation, peripheral neuropathy and thrombocytopenia; no mention of hepatotoxicity or ALT elevations.
997	In analysis of 924 deaths during 2000 among HIV infected patients in France; liver disease accounted for 11% of all deathsl, 31% among HCV coinfected, 20% HBV coinfected, but only 2% in patients without HBV or HCV; 88% of liver deaths were from end stage liver disease and 15% had hepatocellular carcinoma; the authors estimated that only 9% of liver disease deaths were attributable to drug hepatotoxicity.
998	Concise review of the mechanism of action, efficacy, safety and cost of pegaptanib shortly after its approval in the US mentions that intraocular pegaptanib and bevacizumab may be associated with a higher rate of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular thromboses due to their inhibitory effects on angiogenesis.
999	Onset of rash, fever, oral ulcers and adenopathy after 4 weeks of nevirapine therapy with jaundice [bilirubin 9.8 mg/dL, ALT 362 U/L, Alk P 283 U/L, eosinophils 12%], recovery in 6 weeks perhaps with help of intravenous immune globulin infusions.
1000	Among 64 patients with PAH treated with 1 of 4 doses of ambrisentan for 12 weeks, 3.1% developed ALT elevations above 3 times ULN and 2 patients discontinued therapy because of ALT values, but none had symptoms or jaundice.
1001	"Summary of phase III trials comparing tigecycline [n=817] to imipenim/cilastatin [n=825] given for 5-14 days; ALT and AST elevations occurred in ~3% of both groups; one patient withdrew due to ”liver damage""."
1002	51 year old man with CLL and anti-HBc without HBsAg developed reactivation of hepatitis B after 6 monthly courses of rituximab, becoming HBV DNA positive, but without a period of HBsAg detectability and progressive liver failure and death.
1003	Retrospective analysis of 182 patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate between 1985-1999; 16.5% had at least 1 abnormal ALT or AST, but only 2 discontinued drug for these findings and no patient developed clinically apparent liver injury; routine liver biopsies were not done.
1004	32 year old treated for 3 years with testosterone undecanoate for hypogonadism developed jaundice [bilirubin 37 mg/dL, ALT 182 U/L, Alk P 212 U/L], with inflammatory pseudo tumor and biopsy showing paucity of bile ducts, although patient ultimately recovered.
1005	Many children with inflammatory bowel disease, mainly Crohn's disease, suffer from malnutrition and growth retardation. Maintenance of adequate nutrition is extremely important in the management of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease. This can usually be achieved by exclusive elemental formulae and polymeric formulae and rarely necessitates the use of parenteral nutrition. This review presents an update on the nutritional aspects of inflammatory bowel disease in children. 
1006	51 year old woman with fatty liver developed urticaria and myalgias 3 weeks after starting irbesartan [ALT 890 U/L, Alk P and bilirubin not given], resolving within 2-3 weeks of stopping.
1007	50 year old woman developed jaundice 16 months after starting atorvastatin and 3 months after starting ezetimibe therapy [bilirubin 4.6 mg/dL, AST 1626 U/L, Alk P 468 U/L, positive ANA and anti-dsDNA], resolving 6 weeks after stopping both: Case 1.
1008	[structure: see text] Effective, scalable total syntheses and biological evaluation of six phorboxazole A analogues (1-6) have been achieved. Importantly, the C(45-46)-saturated, C(45-46)-alkenyl, and the C(45-46)-E-chloroalkenyl congeners (4, 5, and 6, respectively) reveal low nanomolar tumor cell growth inhibitory activity (GI50's) similar to or, in some cell lines, greater than that of the phorboxazoles across a diverse panel of human cancer cell lines. 
1009	Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-18, IFN-gamma, and IL-1beta play a significant role in the inflammation induced by Helicobacter. During the recent years of H. pylori research, the main focus has been on development of vaccines for therapeutic or prophylactic use against the infection. Both bacterial components of H. pylori as well as engineered vaccines have been tested as well as different forms of administration including systemic and oral/intranasal pathways. 
1010	Two types of polymer-drug conjugates were synthesized starting from styrene-maleic acid anhydride copolymer (SMA). Fenoprofen and gemfibrozil were chosen as model drugs because of their short plasma half lives. Both drugs were first converted to their 2-aminoethylamides, which possess free amino groups capable of reacting with SMA anhydride rings. By modifying the degree and type of substitution, lipophilic and hydrophilic conjugates were obtained. Drug loading in the conjugates was between 17 and 47%. 
1011	Cardiovascular abnormalities are well-known manifestations of tertiary syphilis infections. Most notable in this regard is syphilitic aortitis, which tends to result in aortic root dilatation and its associated complications. A less common manifestation of syphilitic aortitis is coronary artery ostial narrowing related to aortic wall thickening. Herein, we present the case of a 32-year-old female who died of a myocardial infarct due to coronary artery ostial stenosis secondary to syphilitic aortitis. 
1012	The inhibition of superoxide production by human neutrophils has been used to screen New Zealand's unique biota for anti-inflammatory natural products. Bioactivity-directed isolation on an extract of the sponge Dysidea cf. cristagalli led to a new sesquiterpene-quinone (4) with anti-inflammatory activity, plus acetylated hydroquinone (3). These compounds inhibited superoxide production in vitro with IC50's of 3 microM (3) and 11 microM (4). 
1013	Nocardia farcinica is an emerging pathogen in immunosuppressed patients causing both localized and disseminated infections. Many strains of this species are multidrug-resistant and require long-term antibiotic therapy, and consequently the choice of an oral treatment can be problematic. We report here the first case of successful treatment of N. farcinica brain abscess in a renal transplant recipient with an extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin. 
1014	A neonate presented with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), with a persistently elevated phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio. The HPA was responsive to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). His clinical course was dominated by liver failure, associated with perinatal hemochromatosis. He also developed renal tubulopathy. HPA has not previously been reported in association with any of these features. We investigated the etiology of his condition, and discuss the possibility that this represents a novel single-gene disorder. 
1015	The synthesis of two caffeoyl-coumarin conjugates, derived from sagecoumarin, has been accomplished, starting from ferulic acid, isoferulic acid and sesamol. Both compounds exhibited potent inhibitory activities at micromolar concentrations against HIV-1 integrase in 3'-end processing reaction but were less effective against HIV-1 replication in a single-round infection assay of HeLa-beta-gal-CD4+ cells. 
1016	Overactive bladder (OAB) and glaucoma are prevalent and frequently co-exist, particularly in the elderly. Anti-cholinergic drugs are the cornerstone of medical management of OAB. There is a great deal of confusion about the safety of use of the anti-cholinergic medication regarding the risk of glaucoma. This review examines the pharmacological relationship of anti-cholinergic medications used to treat OAB and the various types of glaucoma. 
1017	Review of literature on ceftriaxone associated pseudolithiasis; case report of 53 year old man with chronic hepatitis C who developed jaundice after 7 days of iv ceftriaxone with little change in ALT or AST [bilirubin 5.8 mg/dL, ALT 41 U/L, Alk P 88 U/L], which resolved only once ceftriaxone was stopped, but role of sepsis could not be excluded.
1018	Glucocorticoids have been used for postsurgical pain relief over the last 30 years. They reduce prostaglandins by inhibiting phospholipase A2 and the expression of COX-2 mRNA. The evidence for an analgesic effect is best after oral, orthopaedic, laparoscopic and perianal surgery. Their anti-emetic properties in addition to the analgesic effects make them particularly useful perioperatively. 
1019	We report on a patient with long-standing severe autonomic failure that affected his sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Antibodies against the ganglionic acetylcholine receptors were detected in the serum. Removal of the antibodies by means of plasma exchange resulted in a dramatic clinical improvement.
1020	"Results of open label extended use [12 months] study of eszopiclone in 382 patients who had participated in a placebo controlled trial; eszopiclone was well tolerated and there were ""no systematic differences"" in blood chemistry results during the open label period."
1021	Randomized trial of meropenem vs ceftazidime [both with tobramycin] in 121 patients with cystic fibrosis; ALT elevations occurred in 10-12% of patients in both groups; one patient was withdrawn from meropenem because of abnormal ALT, AST and Alk P levels attributed to therapy.
1022	64 year old man developed rising serum enzymes between days 2 and 5 of risperidone treatment [bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, ALT 186 U/L, Alk P 1326 U/L], values falling to near normal 2 weeks after stopping.
1023	Among 265 patients with PBC treated with ursodiol with or without methotrexate for a median of 7.6 years, transplant-free survival was excellent and not affected by methotrexate therapy; no mention of unexplained ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity.
1024	Concise summary of mechanism of action, pharmacology, efficacy and safety of ramelteon for insomnia, published shortly after its approval in the US, mentions that high doses in rats caused liver cancers, but no mention of hepatotoxicity in humans.
1025	77 year old male developed jaundice after taking a senna preparation for constipation for 3 months [bilirubin 4.9 rising to 16.9 mg/dL, ALT 657 U/L, Alk P 160 U/L], resolving within 1 month of stopping the herbal.
1026	Among 125 women with infertility treated with leuprolide and one of two forms of human urinary menopausal gonadotropins for up to 12 days before hCG administration, side effects were with the two products, except for fewer injection site reactions with the more highly purified preparation; no mention of ALT elevations of hepatotoxicity.
1027	57 year old woman developed abdominal pain 6 months after starting acarbose [bilirubin normal, ALT 454 U/L, GGT 109 U/L]; ALT decreased but remained elevated after reducing dose of acarbose, but resolved completely only when it was stopped; review of 10 cases in literature.
1028	71 year old woman developed polyarthraglias and liver test abnormalities after 4 years of therapy with nitrofurantoin [bilirubin not given, ALT 263 U/L, Alk P 310 U/L, GGT 801 U/L, ANA 1:2560], improving rapidly upon withdrawal and with prednisone therapy.
1029	Pooled data from 44 trials which included 9,416 patients treated with atorvastatin; ALT was >3 times ULN in 0.5% of atorvastatin vs 0.3% of placebo recipients; rates rising from 0.13% with 10 and 20 mg, 0.4% with 40 mg and 0.9% with 80 mg of atorvastatin daily.
1030	Retrospective study of 197 pregnant women in Brazil given nevirapine; enzyme elevations occurred in 5.6%, but only one case of serious liver toxicity, marked by rash and cholestatic hepatitis at 7 weeks.
1031	37 year old woman developed jaundice 4 months after starting “The Right Approach Complex” [which contains green tea extract] for weight loss [bilirubin 11.7 mg/dL, ALT 1788 U/L, Alk P 238 U/L], with resolution in 1 month of stopping and recurrence within 1 month of restarting the product: Case 1.
1032	53 year old woman with osteomyelitis developed muscle weakness 10 days after starting intravenous daptomycin [CK 21,243 U/L, ALT 219 U/L, AST 375 U/L, bilirubin and Alk P not given], with resolution on stopping.
1033	43 year old woman was given methyldopa during pregnancy and developed jaundice when she continued it afterwards [bilirubin 11 mg/dL, ALT 1904 U/L, ANA positive], resolving within 6 weeks of stopping.
1034	"53 year old man with severe psoriasis and hepatic fibrosis caused by methotrexate and hepatitis C responded well to etanercept while HCV RNA levels were unchanged."
1035	Two patients with acute myocardial infarction received an incorrect dose of epoetin [318,000 U: 10 times intended] in a clinical trial of cardiac protection and both had an immediate increase in ALT [peak 386 and 98 U/L] that fell to baseline several weeks after; no mention of bilirubin, Alk P or symptoms.
1036	Among 705 patients with anemia due to cancer chemotherapy treated with darbepoetin given either every week or every 3 weeks, both efficacy and safety were similar with both schedules; hepatic failure was reported in 3 patients, but was considered due to the chemotherapy rather than darbepoetin.
1037	A lorikeet (unidentified species of subfamily Loriinae), which died of coliform septicemia subsequent to an esophageal ulcer also had intranuclear inclusion The ultrastructure bodies in the proximal convoluted tubular lining cells of the kidney. The ultrastructure of these inclusion bodies was compared with those described in experimental lead-induced inclusion bodies of rats. 
1038	Examinations of patients with acute oral poisoning by psychotropic agents have indicated that toxicohypoxic encephalopathy develops, when the high concentrations of toxicants and their active metabolites specifically affect brain structures, resulting in oxidative stress and impaired natural detoxification mechanisms. 
1039	A screening program aimed at discovering inhibitors of the bacterial type III secretion system identified the MeOH extract of the Caribbean sponge Caminus sphaeroconia as an active hit in the initial assay. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract led to the isolation of caminosides A (1) to D (4), a family of antimicrobial glycolipids. The structures of the three new caminosides B (2) to D (4) have been elucidated by spectroscopic analysis. 
1040	L-arginine has attracted a great deal of attention as an agent for refolding denatured proteins, and the mildness of its effects offer hope for a wide range of potential applications for this substance, including medicines with few side effects. We report that both L- and D-arginine inhibits Na+-driven flagellar motors of alkaliphilic Bacillus by competing with Na+, which we take as evidence that arginine specifically binds to a molecular target. 
1041	A case of pneumonitis following exposure to Mycobacterium avium intracellulare in an indoor home spa (hot tub) is presented. The patient complained of recurrent dyspnoea and wheezing. High-resolution CT showed centrilobular ground-glass nodules. Pathological correlation showed interstitial and bronchiolocentric granulomata. Biopsy cultures grew M. avium intracellulare. The patient condition improved following cessation of hot tub use. 
1042	Atypical presentations of cryptococcal infection have been described as manifestations of immune reconstitution in HIV-infected patients following introduction of antiretroviral therapy. We describe a patient presenting with cryptococcal meningitis as an immune reconstitution reaction 10 weeks after initiation of anti-retroviral therapy. Subclinical CSF cryptococcal infection was demonstrated and the serum cryptococcal antigen was negative. 
1043	For many years, medication errors have been a source of serious concern within the health care community. This article examines the definition and assessment of medication errors and some of the emerging technologies used to alleviate them. In addition, recommendations are proposed to improve the drug placement and promotion dimension of the marketing function in the pharmaceuticals industry. 
1044	Superior vena cava stenting for the treatment of malignant superior vena cava obstruction is now well established. It offers simple, rapid, and safe palliation of a distressing and potentially fatal complication of mediastinal malignant disease and compares very favorably with standard therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The following are quality assurance guidelines for superior vena cava stenting. 
1045	Several diseases can be prevented either by primary prevention, such as immunisation or behavioural counselling, or secondary prevention such as screening. The new clinical recommendations include screening of abdominal aortic aneurysm among male smokers and ex-smokers aged between 65 and 75 years and the extension of breast cancer screening by mammography for women aged between 40 and 49 years, as well as screening for diabetes among patients with hypertension or dyslipidemia. 
1046	73 year old woman developed jaundice 3 weeks after addition of metformin to chronic therapy with nateglinide and pioglitazone [bilirubin 6.5 mg/dL, ALT 772 U/L, Alk P 635 U/L], resolving within 7 weeks of stopping: Case 2.
1047	Antilymphocyte antibodies have been widely used in oncology and transplantation and are now being tested in autoimmune diseases. For systemic lupus erythematosus, anti-B-cell antibodies are furthest along in development. This article discusses the B-cell abnormalities found in systemic lupus erythematosus and the clinical and immunologic effects of anti-B-cell therapies. 
1048	Fifty-two untreated patients with late-onset Pompe disease completed questionnaires about their clinical condition and level of handicap at baseline and at 1-year (n = 41) and 2-year follow-ups (n = 40). During this period, declines in functional activities, respiratory function, handicap, and survival were recorded on a group level. This study illustrates the progressiveness of late-onset Pompe disease and indicates the need for close clinical follow-up of both children and adults with this disorder. 
1049	Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-related pulmonary hypertension is a relatively rare disease that can affect HIV sufferers. This is almost always associated with a poor outcome and death. An 18 month-old girl, probably the youngest on record, was diagnosed to have pulmonary hypertension (PHT) and retrospectively found to have HIV infection. Sildenafil was used to control her PHT and she remains alive even after 2 years. 
1050	The prescribing of hormone replacement therapy can give rise to clinical negligence, just like any other area of medical practice -- keeping up to date, ensuring patients are properly informed and so able to consent, and avoiding prescribing pitfalls are the keys to successful risk management. Ultimately, good practice is defensible practice. 
1051	Guidelines for the treatment and management of depression in primary and secondary care have been available for more than a year. Yet anecdotal evidence suggests their implementation is patchy. Treatment should be tailored to the severity of the depression. Psychological treatments can be used alone or in combination with antidepressants, depending on the illness severity. Prescribers and patients should be aware of the side effects of the drugs. 
1052	One of the hallmarks of modern science is technically controlled experimentation. In this paper, we underline how technical developments over the last 150 years have repeatedly created new horizons in amyloid research. The main focus is on chemical and biophysical analyses of amyloid fibrils in vivo and in vitro. Investigations into mechanistic aspects of fibril formation and possible links with pathogenesis are also discussed. 
1053	In this review we present recent studies on the effects of the protein phosphatase inhibitor microcystin on mammalian cells. Whereas high concentrations of microcystin promote liver cell death induced by ROS signalling without the involvement of typical apoptotic proteins, intermediate doses activate classic apoptotic pathways. Low concentrations however, increase liver cell survival and proliferation, and can cause primary liver cancer. 
1054	2-(4-Fluorophenyl)-3-(4-pyridinyl)-5-substituted pyrroles were prepared and evaluated as anticoccidial agents in both in vitro and in vivo assays. Among the compounds evaluated, the dimethylamine-substituted pyrrole 19a is the most potent inhibitor of Eimeria tenella PKG (cGMP-dependent protein kinase). Further SAR studies on the side chain of the 2-pyrrolidine nitrogen did not enhance in vivo anticoccidial activity. 
1055	49 year old woman developed purpuric rash and eosinophilia after 4 weeks of sulfasalazine therapy accompanied by serum enzyme elevations [ALT 171 U/L, Alk P 115 U/L] but no jaundice, rapidly resolving after stopping.
1056	A review presents an incidence of multiple (second) primary tumors of head and neck region resulted from an exposure to tobacco smoke and ethanol. Further, epidemiology, clinical implications, molecular alterations and an impact of genetic factor are described. Finally, alternative theories of origin of multiple primary tumors are discussed. 
1057	Six new steroid glycosides, linckosides F-K, and a related metabolite were isolated from the Okinawan blue starfish Linckia laevigata as mimics or enhancers of nerve growth factor (NGF). Their structures and stereochemistry were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and chemical derivatization. Structure-activity relationships suggest that both a carbon branch modified by a pentose at the side chain and 2'-O-methylxylopyranose at C-3 of the aglycon are important for neuritogenic activity. 
1058	Among 46 patients with leprosy treated with either ethionamide or prothionamide for 6 months, elevations in AST [35-88 U/L] occurred in 18 [39%], often resolving despite continuing medication, and only one patient developed jaundice [on prothionamide].
1059	Severe, acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are a common presentation to emergency departments in the UK. In this group of patients, clinical examination can be unreliable in excluding a pneumothorax. With the increasing role of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in these cases, we present a case report that highlights the need for an urgent chest X-ray prior to commencement of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. 
1060	We present, to our knowledge, the first published cases of optic neuritis associated with adalimumab, a medication in the class of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonists. Approved in recent years by the FDA, adalimumab (Humira, Abbott Laboratories; Abbott Park, IL) is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that targets and blocks the physiologic effects of TNF. Other TNF antagonists have had associations with optic neuritis and demyelinating events. 
1061	A number of pregnant women suffer from psychiatric disorders that require treatment with psychotropic drugs. A literature review suggests that these medications are relatively safe to use during pregnancy. Abrupt discontinuation of these drugs can have both physiological and psychological ramifications, which include unpleasant physical symptoms and re-emergence of the psychiatric condition. Therefore, it is not good practice to discontinue these medications abruptly upon diagnosis of pregnancy. 
1062	56 year old woman with colon cancer developed confusion followed by coma 5 days after a 24 hour intravenous course of fluorouracil [~2 g] with leucovorin [lactate 13.8 mEq/L, arterial pH 7.35, creatinine 6.4 mg/dL], resolving rapidly with hydration and support, ammonia levels normal when tested at time of recovery.
1063	Retrospective analysis of 44 patients treated with linezolid for more than 7 days 8-185 days found cure in 73%, but adverse reactions in 64%, including 25% requiring ICU care: platelet decreases, anemia, gastrointestinal upset, and 10% with serious adverse events of neuropathy, serotonin syndrome and/or lactic acidosis; recommended prospective monitoring.
1064	Review of safety of statins; 38 cases of acute liver failure attributed to the statins were submitted to MedWatch by end of 1999, which gives an estimated rate of 1 per million person years of use; rate of confirmed ALT elevations >3 times ULN is 0.1% with statins and 0.04% with placebo.
1065	"Retrospective analysis of 6 patients with chronic hepatitis and inflammatory arthritis treated with anti-TNF agents for 3-39 months, none had rise in ALT or viral levels during therapy, but 3 with hepatitis B were also on lamivudine."
1066	18 year old woman developed jaundice 5 months after starting flutamide therapy of acne [bilirubin 13 rising to 32 mg/dL, ALT 4717 U/L, GGT 140 U/L], with progressive hepatic failure, liver transplantation but death in perioperative period due to sepsis.
1067	Among 147 patients with age related macular degeneration treated with varying doses of pegaptanib for 54 weeks, ocular adverse events were common, but usually mild-to-moderate, while nonocular events were uncommon and there was no evidence of systemic toxicity.
1068	Analysis of spontaneous adverse reactions reported to Sicilian registries between 1998 and 2004 found 108 serious reactions to NSAIDs, with disproportional reports of hepatitis from nimesulide [3 cases resulting in liver transplantation].
1069	Retrospective analysis of 75 children treated with maintenance thioguanine after chemotherapy for leukemia identified 10 [13%] with portal hypertension [2 with variceal hemorrhage], biopsy in 5 showed nodular regenerative hyperplasia, persistent splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia in most.
1070	49 year old woman with Madura foot who failed to respond to multiple other antifungals had clinical response to voriconazole, but developed abnormal liver tests with Alk P 616 U/L and ALT ~2-3 times normal, but after 18 months developed abdominal pain with ALT 17 times normal and voriconazole was stopped with prompt fall of enzymes to normal.
1071	Systematic review of efficacy and safety of eszopiclone for treatment of insomnia; in 6 large controlled trials involving ~1550 patients, adverse events were uncommon and mild and there were no laboratory test abnormalities identified or mention of clinically apparent liver injury.
1072	32 patients with aspergillosis given voriconazole for 4-24 weeks; 13 [41%] had abnormalities of liver tests, often in first 4 weeks, two were severe, but other abnormalities resolved even on therapy.
1073	Trial comparing entecavir [n=141] to lamivudine [n=145] for lamivudine resistant chronic hepatitis B; ALT flares [>10 times normal] occurred in <1% of entecavir [initial on treatment flare] vs 11% of lamivudine-recipients.
1074	Letter in response to Ho [2005] describing 61 year old Japanese woman who had a clinical response to gefitinib therapy, but developed serum ALT elevations after 8 weeks of therapy, recurring on rechallenge, but later tolerated gefitinib with minimal ALT elevations when given every 5 days instead of daily.
1075	Review of treatment of insomnia in the elderly; chloral hydrate fell out of favor in the 1970s when it was replaced by the benzodiazepines; problems include gastrointestinal intolerance, rapid tolerance, drug-drug interactions, and fatalities from overdose.
1076	Analysis of reports of liver injury from NSAIDs from France and Spain from 1982-2001; among more than 29,000 liver adverse event reports, only 3 were for nabumetone and no details given.
1077	Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome arises in first 20-30 days after HCT, case fatality rate is 15-20%, frequency ~38%, but frequency varies by risk factors [cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics, preexisting liver disease, irradiation dose and use of gemtuzumab], no therapy has proven efficacious but defibrotide and repletion of glutathione deserve evaluation.
1078	"Controlled trial of 3 regimens of varenicline vs placebo for 12 weeks in 647 smokers; ""results of clinical laboratory tests...demonstrated no clinically meaningful differences between varenicline and placebo""."
1079	Letter in response to Musch [2006] questioning the link of the liver injury with kava [vs kavain] and the theoretical role of kava-cytochrome P450 interactions in causing hepatotoxicity.
1080	Three cases of autoimmune hepatitis arising after simvastatin or atorvastatin therapy 6, 20 and 20 weeks after starting [bilirubin 11.3, 3.4 and 5.5 mg/dL, ALT 1749, 1170 and 155 U/L, Alk P of 228, 160, and 203 U/L, all being ANA or SMA positive in titers of 1:40 to 1:160], all responding to prednisone/azathioprine, but remaining on long term therapy with azathioprine or mycophenylate alone.
1081	Intravenous fluconazole prophylaxis in low birth weight infants reduced rate of invasive candidiasis from 6.6% [historical controls] to 0%, but increased direct and total hyperbilirubinemia from 9% to 43%, but no difference in average ALT or AST or rate of elevations above 250 U/L.
1082	Analysis of the FDAs Medwatch database revealed 99 reports of SOS in adult and 6 in pediatric patients treated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin; review of clinical trials and observational studied found highest rates of SOS [14-40%] in patients who underwent HCT within 3 months of receiving gemtuzumab or who received concurrent chemotherapy with potentially hepatotoxic agents.
1083	Concise review on use of echinocandins in invasive fungal infections; ALT elevations occur in 11% of patients receiving caspofungin; isolated cases of clinically significant hepatic injury have occurred, “although it is not clear whether they were drug-related.”.
1084	Review stressing the rarity of liver injury from acetaminophen in children, reported largely by hepatology referral centers, but rarely seen in cohort studies of acetaminophen overdoses; recommended using <75 mg/kg/day as a safe dose in children.
1085	Review of clofarabine and nelarabine, both of which were recently approved for use in ALL and T cell leukemia or lymphoma, dose limiting toxicities being hepatic for clofarabine, neurologic for nelarabine.
1086	Prospective trial of 104 elderly patients given amiodarone or radiofrequency ablation for atrial flutter; no mention of hepatic toxicity during an average of 13 months of therapy.
1087	89 year old woman with breast cancer developed fatigue 2 months after starting anastrozole [bilirubin 1.6 mg/dL, ALT 410 U/L, Alk P 231 U/L], resolving within 2 weeks of stopping.
1088	Among 92 patients undergoing resection of colorectal liver metastases, those who received chemotherapy [mostly oxaliplatin and fluorouracil] were more likely to have vascular changes, but had similar rates of steatosis compared to those who did not receive chemotherapy.
1089	Among 2931 spontaneous adverse event reports made to the sponsor of imiglucerase between 1997 and 2004, 852 were considered related [or unknown]; the major category of adverse events were injection site reactions, urticarial and rash, but 34 were designated “hepatobiliary”; no further details provided.
1090	Among 20 patients with nonresectable liver metastases undergoing isolated 60 minute hepatic perfusions with hyperthermia and melphalan, all patients developed hepatic injury, which was severe in 55% and fatal in 15%; degree of hepatotoxicity correlated with higher melphalan perfusate levels but not with tumor response, melphalan dose, body weight or other clinical features.
1091	Clinical description of 28 patients with “chronic” outcome of drug induced liver injury included one case attributed to amoxicillin with jaundice arising 5 days after a 1 day course with severe hypersensitivity; 6 months later, only evidence of chronic injury was an elevated GGT ~1.4 times ULN.
1092	25 year old man taking 220,000 IU of vitamin A daily developed abnormal liver tests [ALT 104 U/L, Alk P 361 U/L, GGT 392 U/L], biopsy showing hypertrophied stellate cells and advanced fibrosis.
1093	63 year old woman developed ALT elevations [peak 213 U/L] while on gefitinib and anastrozole, which decreased when gefitinib was stopped and increased again when it was restarted.
1094	Analysis of PPI related reports to Spanish Pharmacovigilance Database during 2004 found 58 reports of liver injury from omeprazole [n=36], lansoprazole [7], pantoprazole [12], rabeprazole [2] and esomeprazole [1], correlating somewhat with relative number of prescriptions; 82% were taking other medications; most resolved uneventually upon withdrawal.
1095	20 year old man developed asymptomatic rises in serum enzymes 3 months after starting mirtazapine [bilirubin 0.4 mg/dL, ALT 182 U/L, Alk P 131 U/L], resolving within 2 months of stopping.
1096	Review of liver toxicity of nevirapine and efavirenz, ALT elevations >5 times ULN reported in 1-8% of efavirenz compared to 4-16% of nevirapine recipients; no mention of delavirdine or rilpivirine.
1097	Review of relationship of androgen and estrogen use and liver tumors. Hemangiomas occur more commonly in women [5:1] as does focal nodular hyperplasia [8:1] but their link to estrogens is controversial; adenomas are clearly linked to estrogen use and are rare in men; hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in men than women [9:1 in some studies] and estrogens appear to increase the risk slightly with an odds ratio of 2.5 for any use and 5.8 for long term use.
1098	23 year old woman found to have chronic elevations in serum enzymes [ALT 48 to 265 U/L, GGT 28, Alk P 173 U/L] while taking St. John’s wort; results on stopping herbal were not provided.

1107	33 year old woman developed jaundice 7 weeks after starting minocycline for acne [bilirubin 9.9 mg/dL, ALT 882 U/L, Alk P 191 U/L, ANA positivity], with subsequent worsening despite stopping drug, ultimately requiring liver transplantation; graft showed massive necrosis.
1108	57 year old male HBsAg carrier who developed severe acute hepatitis after 12 weeks of terbinafine therapy [bilirubin 11.0 mg/dL, ALT 1044 U/L, Alk P 167 U/L] and rise in HBV DNA; suggestive of HBV reactivation rather than terbinafine hepatotoxicity per se.
1109	Among 18 patients with gestational trophoblastic cancer, hepatotoxicity arose after 17 of 74 cycles [23%] of chemotherapy using etoposide, cisplatin, methotrexate and dactinomycin, but most instances were mild and the timing, clinical features and source of the injury were not provided.
1110	Among 309 patients with advanced small cell lung cancer treated with either oral or intravenous topotecan, nonhematologic toxicities included diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, anorexia and nausea; no mention of ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity.
1111	Prospective study of 97 patients starting nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy in Uganda followed for 1-20 months; ALT elevations occurred in 22% and were >5 times ULN in 2.2%, one dying of acute liver failure at week 12 [4 weeks after onset].
1112	Among 103 patients with metastatic or recurrent head and neck cancer treated with cetuximab, adverse events included rash, acne and fatigue, and there were 6 infusion related reactions, including one death; no mention of ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity.
1113	Among 1021 adult patients with colorectal adenomas treated with folic acid [1 mg daily] vs placebo with or without aspirin for up to 8 years, the rate of recurrent adenomas was not reduced with either folate or aspirin; no mention of ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity.
1114	"Controlled trial of two formulations of rFSH in 97 women undergoing ovarian stimulation found similar rates of efficacy and side effects; there were minor changes in ALT and Alk P levels, ""but these changes were within reference ranges and not clinically significant""."
1115	Among 1735 adults with HIV infection started on antiretroviral therapy, 3% developed hyperlactatemia; 23 [1%] with lactic acidosis [22 women and 22 on stavudine, 1 on didanosine and zidovudine], 30% mortality; 44 had symptomatic hyperlactatemia [37 women, all 44 on stavudine, 3 also with didanosine], able to switch to zidovudine without recurrence, 2 of 3 relapsed on restarting stavudine.
1116	Retrospective analysis on 194 patients; ALT levels were >3 times ULN in 27% often in first month; among 48 receiving quetiapine, 27% had ALT elevations, 23% at 6 months, but they were modest and none had elevations greater than 3 fold.
1117	39 year old woman developed fatigue and then jaundice ~10 weeks after starting amodiaquine prophylaxis for malaria [bilirubin 14 mg/dL, ALT 1475 U/L, Alk P 108 U/L, protime 17%]; underwent successful liver transplant 6 days later, liver showed massive necrosis.
1118	"Systematic review of 29 controlled trials of incretin-based therapies of diabetes [exenatide, liraglutide, sitagliptin and vildagliptin], concluding that they have ""modest efficacy"", but were well tolerated with few side effects that occur more frequently than in controls; no mention of ALT levels or hepatotoxicity."
1119	Prospective analysis of 293 patients with latent tuberculosis undergoing 6 months of isoniazid therapy; 17 [5.8%] developed ALT elevations 3 >times ULN and 4 had symptoms; risk factors for ALT elevations were alcohol [14.6% v 4.2%], HCV RNA positivity [15.5% vs 3.4%] and baseline ALT elevations.
1120	30 year old man developed jaundice after being on risperidone and lithium for 8 years [bilirubin 4.7 mg/dL, ALT 99 U/L, Alk P 267 U/L], resolving with change of risperidone to ziprasidone, but 1 year later developed recurrent jaundice 3 weeks after starting quetiapine, having tolerated olanzapine.
1121	Results of a phase II trial of 4 doses of raltegravir vs efavirenz in 198 patients on background optimized regimen for 48 weeks; ALT and AST elevations were rare and similar in rate in both groups.
1122	Controlled trial of 6 doses of nebivolol [1.25-40 mg daily] vs placebo in 909 hypertensive patients; side effects were self-limited, mild and not more frequent than with placebo; laboratory monitoring done, but no mention of change in ALT levels.
1123	Review of hepatic adverse events due to rosuvastatin without new information; ALT elevations occur at a similar rate during rosuvastatin as with other statins and average ~0.4%; acute liver failure has not been definitely linked to statins, estimated rate being ~1 per million patient years, similar to background rate; authors argue against routine monitoring of liver enzymes during rosuvastatin therapy.
1124	56 year old man developed jaundice one month after starting alfuzosin [bilirubin 7.6 rising to 25 mg/dL, ALT 1088 U/L, Alk P 167 U/L, eosinophils 8%, high IgE levels]; prolonged jaundice resolving 5 months after stopping.
1125	A case of exophthalmos, and ectopic hyperplastic thyroid tissue occurring at the base of the tongue, in the subhyoid area and in the lateral thyroid lobe is presented. The frequent misdiagnosis of ectopic thyroid tissue as a thyroglossal-duct cyst should make the surgeon cautiously evaluate each case individually. Selective use of scintigrams with I131 is helpful in the preoperative diagnosis to prevent inadvertent excision of a patient's only remaining thyroid tissue.
1126	It has been the purpose of this discussion to review critically the physiologic considerations and clinical evidence regarding the use of Tris buffer in the treatment of acid-base disorders. It is concluded that there is little current evidence, theoretical, experimental, or clinical, to support the view that Tris has a significant therapeutic role. Some possible exceptions to this general conclusion are considered.
1127	Among 452 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer randomized to receive gemcitabine with either paclitaxel or carboplatin, ALT or AST elevations above 5 times ULN occurred in 0.9% vs 1.2% of patients, but other toxicities were more common with the carboplatin than paclitaxel regimen.
1128	Systematic review concluded that milk thistle had no significant effects on mortality in patients with alcoholic liver disease or chronic hepatitis B or C and was not associated with an increased risk of adverse events.
1129	Patient with pseudomonas bacteremia treated with multiple antibiotics, developed elevations in AST [970 U/L], ALT [315 U/L] and Alk P [432 U/L] and mild jaundice within days of starting tobramycin; changing antibiotics did not affect enzyme elevations until tobramycin was stopped with resolution in 1-2 weeks; apparently no symptoms or allergic signs.
1130	Among 105 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer undergoing preoperative chemotherapy [fluorouracil and oxaliplatin] before hepatic resection, the incidence and severity of hepatic sinusoidal dilation was less in those who also received bevacizumab [n=62; 27% any grade, 8% severe] than in those who did not [n=43; 54% any grade, 28% severe].
1131	The definition and staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have provided a unifying approach to CKD that has generated considerable new information on the epidemiology, course, outcomes, and burden of CKD. Eriksen and Ingebretsen propose a change in the current 3 months chronicity criterion of CKD. Whereas longer lengths of chronicity changed the number of patients in stages 3 and 4, mortality remained high in each of their new groupings. Essentially, CKD persisted and remained a risk multiplier of death. 
1132	The paper deals with a patient with secondary erythrocytosis as concequence of renal carcinoma. Although the diagnosis was clear, it was confirmed by bone marrow culture. The colony-forming results were in accordance with secondary erythrocytosis. This case is a good example of high sensitivity of the above mentioned method. The second reason for this paper was the assertion that bone marrow culture can be used as a sensitive follow-up method. 
1133	Infants with cholestatic liver disease are at risk of various nutritional deficiencies. They require regular review with appropriate interventions to prevent complications and ensure optimum possible status if liver transplantation becomes necessary. We propose evidence based and internationally agreed guidelines for their care with recommendations for therapeutic strategies and for service organization. 
1134	"A 35-year-old postpartum lactating woman presented with dyspnea and was found to be in non-diabetic ketoacidosis (pH 7.24, HCO3 10 mmol/L, urine ketones>80 mg/dL). Rapid clinical and laboratory resolution occurred after intravenous dextrose and enteral feeding along with discontinuation of lactation. This represents a rarely reported case of lactation ""bovine"" ketoacidosis in humans. We review the historical precedence for the diagnosis and detail the underlying physiology. "
1135	In this short review, we highlight and reference the new developments in the newly emerged field of Interventional Neurophysiology in relation to neurosurgery, particularly the functional neurosurgery. The review covers clinical aspects of neurophysiological interventions into investigation, treatment and research on the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurological disorders. 
1136	The 2006 version of the guideline for prophylaxis and treatment of osteoporosis recommends vitamin K(VK)supplementation in the state of its deficiency. As VK(2) gained grade B in all aspects in the guideline, single use of the drug is limited. VK(2) may be used concurrently with other drugs in the treatment of osteoporosis. In this paper, the results of our concurrent use of two of vitamin D(3), VK(2), and EHDP are summarized, and the combined therapy including VK(2) will be reviewed. 
1137	Despite the increased popular attention that sexual dysfunction has received in the recent past, more often than not physicians and their patients remain avoidant of the topic in clinical visits. The patient hesitancy in this dynamic suggests that clinicians can best serve their patients by routinely initiating discussions about sexual function during clinical visits. In this article, we provide an overview of the female sexual dysfunctions and address screening and treatment options.

1140	We report the first case of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in a patient with multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosed within two years of receiving mitoxantrone therapy. Previously only acute forms of leukemia particularly acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) have been associated with mitoxantrone treatment in MS. This underscores the need for only using mitoxantrone in severe treatment-unresponsive cases of MS. 
1141	The sponge Psammoclemma sp. was investigated as part of our studies to discover P2X 7 receptor antagonists for the treatment of inflammatory disease. The biological activity of this extract was found to be due to the cytotoxicity of two new bromotyrosine alkaloids, psammaplysenes C (1) and D (2), and not P2X 7-specific activity. Their structures were determined by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. 
1142	On 24 July 2005, six members of a single family were admitted to the Medicine and Pediatrics Department of Khulna Medical College Hospital, Khulna, Bangladesh, with a history of ingestion of puffer fish.

1149	Among 80 women on medroxyprogesterone [given by depo injection every 3 months] for 1-4 years, there were no consistent differences in mean ALT [15-20 U/L], Alk P [64-71 U/L] or bilirubin [0.49-0.54 mg/dL] levels compared to controls.
1150	Controlled trial of lenalidomide in 351 patients with refractory multiple myeloma showed improvement in response rates and survival time; side effects of neutropenia, muscle cramps, constipation, nausea and dizziness were common, but liver abnormalities were not mentioned.
1151	Review of the pharmacology, safety and efficacy of posaconazole; a combined safety analysis of data from 428 patients in clinical trials found that 2% of patients discontinued therapy because of liver test abnormalities; no discussion of hepatotoxicity.
1152	Among 57 patients undergoing liver transplantation for acute liver failure during a 17 year period at a single referral center in Belgium, 5 were attributed to NSAIDs including 3 to nimesulide; 22-59 year old women exposed for 2 days to 2 months [bilirubin 10-22 mg/dL, ALT 21-34 times ULN], successfully transplanted within 1-7 days of presentation with encephalopathy.
1153	Review of hepatotoxicity of antiretroviral drugs with recommendations on management, stopping therapy if symptoms arise, with overt jaundice [direct bilirubin], evidence of mitochondrial toxicity, ALT >10 times ULN, ALT at lower levels if newly marketed agent; important to rule out other causes; problematic agents include didanosine, stavudine and zidovudine, nevirapine and efavirenz, full dose ritonavir and tipranavir.
1154	45 year old man developed fatigue and body aches and took 4 g of acetaminophen for 2 days developing jaundice, stupor and coma [bilirubin 11.3 mg/dL, ALT 580 U/L, Alk P 406 U/L, IgM anti-HEV positive]; given N-acetylcysteine and recovered; authors raise issue of whether acetaminophen worsened course of acute hepatitis E.
1155	Acquired toxoplasmosis is more frequently an unrecognized disease. Immunocompetent adults and adolescents with primary infection are generally asymptomatic, or symptoms observed may include malaise, fever, and lymphadenopathy. In contrast, immunocompromised patients may experience severe manifestation including encephalitis and multi system organ failure. We report a case of toxoplasmic hepatitis presenting with hepatomegaly in an immunocompetent patient. 
1156	Immunohistochemical study revealed overexpression of prolactin receptors in central and peripheral cells of intrahepatic grafts from H27 rat hepatoma without changes in compartmentalization compared to hepatocytes of intact animals. Experiments with gonadectomized animals showed that the hormonal regulation of prolactin receptors in both types of tumor cells does not differ from that in normal liver cells (positive estrogen-dependent regulation and negative androgen-dependent regulation). 
1157	The regulatory effect of tetrapeptide pancragene on the morphology and function of pancreatic tissues was shown in rats with diabetes mellitus, which suggests good prospects of this drug.

1162	The final quarter of the twentieth century saw a rise in the incidence of lymphoma, and it is now one of the most common neoplasms in the United States. As our understanding of lymphoma has grown, it has become clear that lymphomagenesis is a complex process and that many of the pathologic subtypes of lymphoma have different etiologies. This has prompted epidemiologists to investigate potential environmental causes of lymphoma. Below is a review of the body of literature that has resulted from these pursuits. 
1163	The efficacy of prophylaxis of tromboembolic complications in surgical treatment of 331 patients with morbid obesity, who underwent different bariatric operations, is estimated. The comparative analysis and results of application of non-fractionized heparin and low molecular weight heparins (Fraxiparin) in patients, suffering morbid obesity, are presented. 
1164	Data supporting the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic psychocutaneous techniques continues to accumulate. These interventions are used for the treatment of common and psychocutaneous skin conditions. They are most commonly used as adjuncts to traditional therapies. This article will review the data on the effectiveness of hypnosis, biofeedback, psychotherapy, meditation, support groups, guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation, and psychotherapy. 
1165	A new class of C8-linked pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-chalcone conjugates have been prepared by employing a solid-phase synthetic protocol.

Interestingly, some of these molecules have shown enhanced DNA-binding affinity and promising anticancer activity on a large number of human cancer cell lines. 
1166	Prescription drugs play an essential and growing role in Canada's healthcare system and the health of Canadians. But some drugs are not used correctly (misuse), used too frequently (overuse) or not used nearly enough (underuse), resulting in missed health benefits, harm to individual Canadians and unnecessary costs. In this article, we highlight lessons learned from the Health Council of Canada's synthesis of evidence and a recent symposium regarding what works to improve the appropriateness of prescribing. 
1167	N-Benzylanilines were designed and synthesized as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-2 inhibitors using de novo drug design systems based on the X-ray structure of VEGFR-2 kinase domain.

1170	We describe a renal transplant patient who developed an abdominal pain in the hypogastrium area and a urinary tract infection. An abdominal RX, and later, a computerized tomography showed an air collection in the bladder wall. Emphysematous cystitis is a rare complication of the urinary tract infection, more frequently in patients with diabetes mellitus. It is important to treat it since the beginning, so we can avoid several complications. 
1171	We report a case of a 61-year-old woman treated for a suspected verapamil overdose with continuous calcium chloride infusion, resulting in severe hypercalcemia of 32.3 mg/dL (8.07 mmol/L) with a normal range of 8.6-10.5 mg/dL (2.15-2.63 mmol/L). Treatment with acute hemodialysis rapidly normalized the serum calcium level, but the patient later died of vasoconstrictive complications of hypercalcemia. 
1172	The United States is currently in the midst of a heart failure (HF) epidemic. All predictions suggest that this will increase in both scope and impact. Consequently new methods to improve the clinical outcomes and financial consequences for HF treatment are needed. This manuscript reviews the potential of Emergency Department Observation to improve care for the decompensated HF patient. Suggested clinical pathways, order sheets, and the potential for improved outcomes are presented. 
1173	Hypertension in subjects on long term dialysis is frequent. Its origins are found in extracellular volume overload, which is complicated by increased peripheral arterial resistance. The latter is affected by many systems, including that of renin-angiotensin, endothelin, nitric oxide, the sympathetic nervous system, and others. The interaction between these factors may explain why the control of hypertension in dialysis patients requires ongoing attention to the many aspects of good dialysis. 
1174	Cardiac tumors are rare; however, they pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges on the physician and, in most cases, interdisciplinary approaches are necessary. The present article summarizes the most frequent cardiac tumors and discusses the diagnostic aspects and therapeutic consequences. The focus of this article is on primary cardiac tumors. 
1175	Photo-onycholysis associated with drugs is an uncommon disorder. We report the case of a woman who developed photo-onycholysis on multiple nails after uptake of olanzapine. Substitution of olanzapine with aripiprazole further exacerbated the problem. The possible mechanisms of photo-onycholysis development by modern atypical antipsychotics, modulating dopamine receptors, are discussed. 
1176	Systematic variation of the branching and basicity of the side chain of chloroquine yielded a series of new 7-chloro-4-aminoquinoline derivatives exhibiting high in vitro activity against four different strains of P. falciparum. Many of the compounds tested showed excellent potency against chloroquine sensitive and resistant strains. In particular 4b, 5a, 5b, 5d, 17a, and 17b were found to be significantly more potent than chloroquine against the resistant strains Dd2 and FCB.

1221	Metastasis is the end product of an evolutionary process in which diverse interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment yield alterations that allow these cells to transcend their programmed behavior. Tumor cells thus populate and flourish in new tissue habitats and, ultimately, cause organ dysfunction and death. Understanding the many molecular players and processes involved in metastasis could lead to effective, targeted approaches to prevent and treat cancer metastasis.
1222	Patients with chronic kidney disease have been advised for many years to reduce their protein intake. This review addresses the biochemical, pathophysiologic, and nutritional background that underlies this recommendation. The clinical and therapeutic evidence for prescribing such diets is addressed, as well as the potential caveats. A proposed method for managing and monitoring patients also is provided. 
1223	Recent studies have demonstrated efficacy of bevacizumab for recurrent ovarian cancer, but few data on its use and gastrointestinal potential complications when administered as adjuvant chemotherapy after cytoreductive surgery are available. In this study, we report the first case of a rectovaginal fistula in this indication. 
1224	In this study, we describe a highly selective etherification procedure of unprotected morroniside catalyzed by molecular iodine in acetone. The etherification reaction furnished 7-O-alkyl ether derivatives in reasonable yields within few hours under neutral conditions.

This patient was treated by mycophenolate mofetil for a bullous pemphigoid resistant to corticotherapy. 
1235	We discuss why we should measure parameters of 'life' and not 'death' in choosing a therapy for cancer and what are the flaws and difficulties in measuring cancer specific deaths. We then submit those parameters which can be measured with high precision and validity in cancer patients and so should be recorded to guide us in deciding the best therapy. 
1236	We report four patients on long-term antiepileptic drugs, without any history of anabolic steroid or oral contraceptive use, who had path-proven hepatic adenomas at our institution. Imaging review of one case is presented here. An exhaustive literature search reveals only four other such case reports, none from the North American continent. 
1237	Heparin-induced immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a life-threatening complication of heparin treatment. When HIT is clinically suspected, heparin treatment should immediately be replaced with an alternative, fast-acting, anticoagulant agent, and blood tests should be carried out to verify or to exclude the diagnosis. Argatroban has recently been approved for HIT treatment in Denmark. Recommendations for dosing of argatroban in HIT patients with and without comorbities are presented. 
1238	Antibodies to the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii were assayed in sera of 200 goats, 100 pigs, 126 cattle from various states of Malaysia, and 135 dogs and 55 cats around Ipoh region using an indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT, cut-off titer 1:200); antibodies were found in 35.5% of goats, 14.5% cats, 9.6% dogs, 7.9% local cattle and 4% yellow cattle but not in pigs. Results indicate that infection is most prevalent in goats.

1240	In this essay, we draw attention to some recent downsides and surprises of multiple sclerosis (MS) therapeutics. These include experiences with recent head-to-head trials of interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate, dose escalation trials, frustrating efforts with progressive MS trials, failures of smart concepts and designer therapies, and harsh lessons from newly observed adverse reactions. 
1241	Controlled trial of fixed vs “loose” dose combinations of amodiaquine and artesunate in 750 children with P. falciparum malaria; similar efficacy [92%] and safety; 7 [~1%] had ALT elevations, one >1000 U/L, but bilirubin normal and no symptoms.
1242	"We report five cases of fatal bupropion overdose with post mortem bupropion concentrations ranging from 3.1 to >20 mg/L. Four patients had ingested a sustained-release formulation of bupropion and had evidence of pill ""bodies"" in their stomach with significantly elevated blood bupropion concentrations. The pills found in these patients may represent the residual matrix/shell with significant portions of the actual bupropion released and absorbed by the patients. "

The requisites for successful candidate(s) of clinical molecular imaging are reviewed for future development. 
1245	Controlled trial of 4 week course of silymarin vs placebo in 105 patients with acute viral hepatitis found no differences in outcome, but minimally faster resolution of dark urine and jaundice; there were no serious adverse events and side effects were uncommon and similar in frequency between the two groups.
1246	A series of phenoxy benzoxaboroles were synthesized and screened for their inhibitory activity against PDE4 and cytokine release. 5-(4-Cyanophenoxy)-2,3-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole (AN2728) showed potent activity both in vitro and in vivo. This compound is now in clinical development for the topical treatment of psoriasis and being pursued for the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis. 
1247	Pre-operative determination of the risk of liver dysfunction has come under criticism with regards to its usefulness in clinical practice. Opinion is split between centres which use such tests uniformly on all patients and those where clinical judgment alone is used. Published data would not suggest any difference in mortality, morbidity or liver failure rates between these groups. This review outlines and presents the evidence for pre-operative quantification of functional liver remnant volume. 
1248	Ethoprop, oxamyl, PP 156, fenamiphos, carbofuran , AC 64,475, Bunema M, CG 12223, aldicarb, aldicarbsulfoxide, and aldicarbsulfone were tested for their effects on hatching and emergence of larvae from cysts of Heterodera schachtii.

1437	The authors report the case of a patient with a background of trapped lung following thoracocentesis who developed an anterolateral intercostal pneumothoracocele resulting in a pneumothorax necessitans (PN). Our purpose is to highlight the pathophysiology and interesting radiological features associated with PN in trapped lung. Our case is particularly unique due to the subacute nature of its presentation in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis and unusual pre-existing lung pathology. 
1438	Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating disease with limited therapeutic options. Moreover, when PAH occurs in patients diagnosed with systemic sclerosis, worse outcomes are observed. The purpose of this review is to discuss the etiologies of PAH found in the systemic sclerosis patient, limitations of current medical therapies, and, finally, potential therapies for patients with this combination. 
1439	The aim of this study was to synthesize and evaluate diazapentacyclic analogs for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity. The pentacyclic analogs were synthesized by one-pot three-component domino reactions in a microwave synthesizer. Most of the compounds exhibited moderate to good AChE inhibitory activity, compound 5i showed potent inhibitory activity with IC50 1.12 Â± 0.01 ÂµM and this may provide a new lead for developing potential inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease. 
1440	Among 484 patients with diabetes inadequately controlled by pioglitazone who were treated with lixisenatide or placebo injections for 24 weeks, glycemic control was improved by addition of lixisenatide and adverse events including nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions; no mention of ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity.

The gel-like state of intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) or intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) remains a big puzzle for drug designers. Here, we propose a novel concept for drug design by understanding protein disintegration and protein-protein interaction (PPI) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and propose a possible approach for overcoming current obstacles in IDP drug design.  
1448	Dengue outbreaks have increased in size and frequency in Australia, and transfusion-transmitted dengue poses a risk to transfusion safety. Using whole blood samples collected during the large 2008-2009 dengue epidemic, we estimated the risk for a dengue-infectious blood donation as â‰1 in 7,146 (range 2,218-50,021). 
1449	To determine the effect of retinoic acid (RA) in neuroblastoma we treated RA sensitive neuroblastoma cell lines with 9-cis RA or ATRA for 9 days, or for 5 days followed by absence of RA for another 4 days. Both isomers induced apoptosis and reduced cell density as a result of cell differentiation and/or apoptosis. Flow cytometry revealed that 9-cis RA induced apoptosis more effectively than ATRA. The expression profile of apoptosis and survival pathways was cell line specific and depended on the isomer used. 
1450	Biological therapy with tumour necrosis factor alpha antibodies continues to offer a life-changing option for a range of autoimmune and inflammatory skin conditions. We present three cases of sarcoidosis, with refractory cutaneous disease successfully treated with infliximab. A review of the literature shows increased numbers of cases of refractory cutaneous sarcoidosis successfully cleared with infliximab therapy.

1452	Pooled analysis of results of three controlled trials of perampanel in patients with refractory partial onset seizures, mentions that there were no deaths and that serious adverse events occurred in 5.0% of placebo and 5.5% of perampanel recipients, none of which were liver related and that there were “no clinically important mean changes in laboratory values”.
1453	Among 115 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease treated with miglustat in clinical practice, 49 [43%] stopped treatment mostly because of adverse events; no mention of liver related adverse events or ALT elevations.
1454	"Review of drugs used for depression mentions that MAO inhibitors ""remain valuable alternatives for patients with moderate to severe treatment resistant depression; discussion of side effects does not mention hepatotoxicity."
1455	Among 347 adults with refractory, advanced, ALK-positive lung cancer treated with crizotinib [250 mg twice daily] or conventional chemotherapy [pemetrexed or docetaxel intravenously every 3 weeks], progression free survival was longer with crizotinib [7.7 vs 3 months] and adverse events included ALT or AST elevations in 38% vs 15%, which were above 5 times ULN in 16% vs 2%, and one patient [0.5%] died of liver failure.
1456	A 45-year-old healthy man wishes to climb Mount Kilimanjaro (5895 m) in a 5-day period, starting at 1800 m. The results of a recent exercise stress test were normal; he runs 10 km 4 or 5 times per week and finished a marathon in less than 4 hours last year. He wants to know how he can prevent becoming ill at high altitude and whether training or sleeping under normobaric hypoxic conditions in the weeks before the ascent would be helpful. What would you advise?
1457	Among 98 patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1, and HIV coinfection treated with peginterferon and ribavirin with vs without boceprevir for up to 48 weeks, SVR rates were higher with boceprevir [63% vs 29%], but serious adverse events rates were similar; no mention of liver related events or ALT elevations.
1458	64 year old man with HBsAg [without HBV DNA and with normal enzymes] and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia received prophylaxis with lamivudine during and for 12 months after a 2 year course of chlorambucil and rituximab, but developed reactivation of hepatitis B 6 months later [ALT 2260 U/L, HBV DNA 28,812 IU/mL], resolving rapidly with tenofovir therapy.
1459	Systematic review of the literature on the mechanism of action, efficacy and safety of crofelemer in noninfectious diarrhea among antiretroviral treated adults with HIV infection, mentions that adverse events were uncommon and mild, but could include flatulence [3.1%], abdominal distention [1/7%], constipation [1.7%], dyspepsia [1.3%], nausea [1.3%] and ALT elevations [1.3%].
1460	Intratumoral hemorrhage within a myxopapillary ependymoma of the conus medullaris and cauda equina is rare. Most patients with myxopapillary ependymoma present insidiously, but they may present with hemorrhage or cauda equina syndrome. Limited number of case reports available has described this condition only in adult patients. We report our experience with intratumoral hemorrhage of myxopapillary ependymoma of the conus medullaris during weight lifting in a 15-year-old boy.  
1461	Mastocytosis is a clonal disease derived from hematopoietic bone marrow progenitor cells. Clinical manifestations of the disease vary greatly depending on tissue involvement. Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody licensed in the treatment of asthma with increasing reports of clinical eficiency in other allergic diseases. We describe a case of a patient with mastocytosis responsive clinically and patho-physiologically after anti-IgE treatment. 
1462	Autoinflammatory syndromes and diseases are a group of disorders of innate immunity. This group has grown rapidly in recent years as a result of research advancements in molecular biology and genetics. These diseases often present with skin manifestations and the dermatologist may not recognize the constellation of symptoms and medical history as a systemic inflammatory disease. Dermatologists would benefit from a deeper understanding of these diseases and the new treatments available for them. 
1463	Dry eye disease and ocular surface disorders may be caused or worsened by viral agents. There are several known and suspected virus associated to ocular surface diseases. The possible pathogenic mechanisms for virus-related dry eye disease are presented herein. This review serves to reinforce the importance of ophthalmologists as one of the healthcare professional able to diagnose a potentially large number of infected patients with high prevalent viral agents.  
1464	Pancreatoblastoma is a rare neoplasm encountered most commonly in infants and young children. Unresectable or metastatic tumors have a poor prognosis despite adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. We report the successful use of CT-guided radiofrequency ablation subsequent to intensive chemotherapy in an 8-year-old girl with liver-metastasizing pancreatoblastoma and with right and segment 4 portal vein tumor thrombosis. She has been in remission for 3Â years.  
1465	We describe a patient who underwent selective interventional radiation therapy (SIRT) for inoperable colorectal cancer liver metastases and who developed gastritis as a direct result. The Yttrium microspheres are seen in the biopsy. The anatomical basis for the complication is presented. New treatments result in new iatrogenic complications.  
1466	Here we present the complete genome sequences of two Helicobacter pylori rifampin-resistant (Rif(r)) strains (Rif1 and Rif2). Rif(r) strains were obtained by in vitro selection of H.Â pylori 26695 on agar plates with 20Â Âµg/ml rifampin. The genome data provide insights on the genomic diversity of H.Â pylori under selection by rifampin.  
1467	There are no sensitive and specific biomarkers that aid in the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study was to determine the mRNA and protein expression levels of beclin 1 (BECN1) and nuclear factor-ÎşB (NF-ÎşB)p65 in patients with HCC, to evaluate their value as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Immunohistochemistry and

1469	Two cases of domestically acquired fascioliasis are reported. Patient One was a 63-year-old male who developed a febrile illness 2 months after eating watercress in Marin County. Patient Two was a 38-year-old male who had eaten watercress with Patient One, and also developed a febrile illness. Both patients had eosinophilia and liver lesions on imaging. Diagnosis was made by serology and treatment was with triclabendazole. 
1470	Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated hypersensitivity reaction often related to viral infection or medications. Infection-induced EM is typically self-limited and commonly caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) or Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP); recurrent EM is almost always associated with HSV. We present a concise overview of diagnostic techniques for HSV and MP, as repeatedly elevated MP titers in our case led to a delayed diagnosis of HSV-induced EM. 
1471	Hepatoid carcinoma of the ovary (HCO) was first reported in 1987 in 5 cases of malignant ovarian tumors which were similar to hepatocarcinoma in the histological analysis. We report the first case in the literature of a patient diagnosed with HCO treated using HIPEC after extensive cytoreductive surgery, and we discuss the value of this therapeutical option in patients with HCO.  
1472	Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) is conjugated with TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) via a linker that is stable in extracellular fluid, while it is cleaved by cathepsin once the conjugate has entered a tumor cell, thus activating the antimitotic mechanism of MMAE. The TRAIL-MMAE conjugate is a conceptually viable therapeutic strategy with improved in vitro antitumor activity, cell circle arrest and specific accumulation in tumor to treat TRAIL-resistant tumors.  
1473	+Gz-time tolerance curves were developed to predict when exposure to +Gz stress exceeds human tolerance resulting in neurologic signs and symptoms. The +Gz-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) curves were developed to predict when +Gz stress induces G-LO
1474	We explored the association between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene with suicide using 307 Japanese completed suicides, 380 healthy controls, and data from previously published samples. The meta-analyses of the valine with methionine in codon 66 (Val66Met) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) showed that the Met-allele tended to be associated with attempted suicide in Asian populations, but not with the completed suicide.  
1475	The aim of this study was to further explore the possible mechanisms of montelukast on oral mice ovalbumin-induced eosinophilic gastroenteritis in a mouse model. The results indicated that montelukast could prevent levels of eotaxin-1 and interleukin-5 in intestinal mucosa homogenate when compared with model group. Interestingly, the increase of major basic protein expression in jejunal tissue also was attenuated by treated with montelukast. 
1476	When new compounds targeting the brain are developed, it is important to assess both the acute and chronic effects on brain functioning. This can be done non-invasively using a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This review discusses the possibilities of both stimulation-based and resting state fMRI to study pharmacological modulations of the rodent brain. Moreover, attention is given to the use of anesthetics which could importantly influence the outcome of both techniques.

1482	Metaanalysis of publications on the safety and efficacy of the SGLT-2 inhibitors states that: “regarding liver related adverse events, regulatory authorities’ reports concluded that slight imbalance among patients treated with dapagliflozin or canagliflozin and control groups were probably not associated with the study drug”.
1483	Among 76 children undergoing cytoreductive therapy in preparation of hematopoietic cell transplantation who received rasburicase to prevent tumor lysis syndrome, 3 patients developed hypersensitivity symptoms, but there were no serious adverse events attributed to the rasburicase therapy.
1484	Qualitative and quantitative testing of circulating cell free DNA (CCFDNA) can be applied for the management of malignant and benign neoplasms. Detecting circulating DNA in cancer patients may help develop a DNA profile for early stage diagnosis in malignancies. The technical issues of obtaining, using, and analyzing CCFDNA from blood will be discussed.  
1485	The cryptococcal antigen (CRAG) lateral flow assay (LFA) had 100% sensitivity and specificity on cerebrospinal fluid samples. Pretreatment LFA titers correlated with quantitative cultures (R(2) = 0.7) and predicted 2- and 10-week mortality. The CRAG LFA is an accurate diagnostic assay for CSF and should be considered for point-of-care diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis.  
1486	Neonatal hypoglycaemia can lead to devastating consequences. Thus, constant, accurate and safe glucose monitoring is imperative in neonatal care. However, point-of-care (POC) devices for glucose testing currently used for neonates were originally designed for adults and do not address issues specific to neonates. This review will address currently available monitoring options and describe new methodologies for non-invasive glucose monitoring in newborns.  
1487	We report a patient with colchicine-induced myoneuropathy. Myoneuropathy is an under-recognized complication of colchicine. The weakness seen in our patient improved fairly rapidly after discontinuation of colchicine.  
1488	Fatty liver can be induced by obesity, some drugs and alcohol intoxication. In this liver lesion, lipid accumulation can involve only some hepatocytes but the significance of this cell-to-cell heterogeneity is unknown. In a recent work, Dr Pol et al. propose that high-fat hepatocytes could protect the cell population against oxidative stress and lipotoxicity.  
1489	Concise review of the mechanism of action, clinical efficacy, safety and cost of dolutegravir shortly after its approval for use in HIV infection in the US, mentions that it is generally well tolerated, causes hypersensitivity reactions in <1% of persons and has been associated with ALT elevations in patients with hepatitis B or C coinfection.
1490	Among 11 elderly adults with AML treated with clofarabine with low doses of cytarabine, the response rate was 27%, but the mortality rate rose to 73% at 8 weeks and one death was attributed to hepatic and renal failure.
1491	"Among 1110 patients with renal cell cancer treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, bilirubin elevations ?1.5 times ULN occurred in 16% on pazopanib vs 9% on sunitinib, and the accumulated rate of the elevations was higher in patients who were homozygous for the UGT1A1 polymorphisms of Gilbert syndrome."
1492	33 year old Korean woman developed rash and fever 3 weeks after starting ziprasidone and lithium, with resolution of stopping both and recurrence one day after restarting ziprasidone [ALT 141, atypical lymphocytes 12%], resolving within 2 weeks of stopping.
1493	Among 753 patients with HIV infection enrolled in long term extension studies of fosamprenavir containing regimens for up to 8 years, ALT elevations above 5 times ULN occurred in 8% overall, 3% of those with monoinfection and 13-35% of those with HBV or HCV coinfection; and among 5 deaths, none were due to liver disease.
1494	18 year old woman with antiphospholipid syndrome developed spontaneous intrahepatic hemorrhage after 6 years of warfarin therapy [INR 1.8, bilirubin and ALT not given, Alk P 214 U/L], recurring on restarting warfarin, but not when switched to clopidogrel and hydroxychloroquine.
1495	A year after seeing a physician for abdominal pain and obstipation and being told he couldn't be adequately evaluated without insurance, an uninsured man is diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer. Like thousands of other Americans, he will die for lack of insurance.

1501	"Among 218 men with castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer not responding to docetaxel who were treated with cabazitaxel and prednisone in a compassionate use program in Italy, adverse events possibly related to therapy included 3 cases of ""hepatic failure"" one of whom died; no details provided."
1502	The allelopathic weed Russian knapweed (Centaurea repens) was found to contain polyacetylenes VIII-XIV in the roots. Dose vs. response of the root length elongation against lettuce, alfalfa, barnyard grass, and red millet showed IX to be active. Closely related isomers were not active. Examination of the soil surrounding the Russian knapweed roots revealed the presence of IX in sufficient concentration to have an appreciable effect on the surrounding plant community.  
1503	Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a human herpesvirus-8-associated lymphoangioproliferative neoplasm. Both human and viral interleukin-6 (IL-6) proteins seem to drive much of the clinical manifestations of KS, which provides a new target for intervention by using IL-6-neutralizing antibodies. We describe the clinical course of a patient in whom tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor antibody approved for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, was effective not only in inducing RA remission but was also safe for KS.  
1504	Radioresistance is a frustrating obstacle for patients with colorectal cancers (CRCs) undergoing radiotherapy. There is an urgent need to find an effective agent to increase the sensitivity of CRCs to radiation. Honokiol, an active compound purified from Magnolia, was found to radiosensitize colorectal cancer cells both  
1505	While it is logical to use hypomethylating agents to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), trial results with azacitidine and decitabine have been inconsistent. Azacitidine confers a survival benefit in higher-risk MDS patients, while decitabine does not. Neither agent has demonstrated a survival advantage in older AML patients in prospective studies. Reasons for this are explored here along with a recommendation to reconsider clinical trial design endpoints.  
1506	By combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry the gibberellin present in suspensors of heart-shaped embryos of Phaseolus coccineus has been identified as Gibberellin A1 (GA1). The amount of GA1 in 2000 suspensors (452 mg), as estimated by gas chromatography. was 4ÎĽg. The presence of GA1 in suspensors of P. coccineus is discussed in relation to our present knowledge of the occurrence of many gibberellins in developing seeds and immature fruits of the same species.  
1507	Statins, widely used to lower cholesterol levels, cause myopathy in some patients. Mangravite etÂ al. (2013) show that a single nucleotide polymorphism decreasing expression of glycine amidinotransferase (GATM), the enzyme regulating creatine biosynthesis, is associated with reduced statin myopathy. Whether reduced creatine production protects against statin myopathy remains to be determined.  
1508	Many marine-derived polysaccharides and their analogues have been reported as showing anticancer and cancer preventive properties. These compounds demonstrate interesting activities and special modes of action, differing from each other in both structure and toxicity profile. Herein, literature data concerning anticancer and cancer preventive marine polysaccharides are reviewed. The structural diversity, the biological activities, and the molecular mechanisms of their action are discussed.  
1509	Evidence is presented that a dominant allele, S, is expressed as a receptor for K88 on the brushborder surface of the pig intestinal cell. The homozygous recessive (ss) lacks this receptor. The receptor enables K88 - positive coliforms to adhere to the gut of the piglet which they must do if they are to cause neonatal diarrhoea. The homozygous recessive is thus a disease resistant animal.A possible reason for the persistence of the dominant (susceptible) gene is given.  
1510	Workshops are an important part of the IFPA annual meeting as they allow for discussion of specialized topics. At IFPA meeting 2013 there were twelve themed workshops, four of which are summarized in this report. These workshops related to various aspects of placental biology but collectively covered areas of pregnancy pathologies and placental metabolism: 1) diabetes in pregnancy; 2) lipids, fatty acids and the placenta; 3) oxygen in placental development and pathologies; 4) stem cells and pathologies.  
1511	Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death among persons with HIV globally. HIV-related research in TB endemic areas raises some unique and important ethical issues in infection control related to protecting both research participants and personnel. To address such concerns, this article provides practical guidance to help research teams develop strategies to prevent TB transmission in studies involving persons with HIV in TB endemic settings. 
1512	We report a rare case of fibrosing mediastinitis diagnosed by thoracoscopic biopsy. A 56-year-old female visited our hospital with an abnormal mediastinal shadow on chest X ray. Chest computed tomography revealed a paravertebral tumor from Th9 to Th11. Pathological examination of thoracoscopic biopsy specimen showed fibrous tissue with mild inflammation and no malignant feature. Final diagnosis was idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis. The paravertebral lesion shrinked spontaneously 5 months later after biopsy.  
1513	A novel function of polyarginine as an activator of the immune system is reported. Single-molecule fluorescence imaging and single-molecule force measurements demonstrate that polyarginine binds specifically to the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), inducing receptor dimerization and activation. Moreover, polyarginine induced immune activation inhibits tumor growth. These results suggest the potential use ofÂ polyarginine for cancer immunotherapy.  
1514	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial, neurodegenerative disease that poses tremendous difficulties in pinpointing its precise etiology. A toolkit, which specifically targets and modulates suggested key players, may elucidate their roles in disease onset and progression. We report high-resolution insights on the activity of a small molecule (L2-NO) which exhibits reactivity toward Cu(II)-amyloid-Î˛ (AÎ˛) over Zn(II)-AÎ˛. 
1515	Folate deficiency in patients with Crohn's disease may be due to a combination of factors: poor diet, malabsorption, increased requirements due to inflammation of the mucosa, and the taking of certain drugs as sulfasalazine and methotrexate. A significant proportion of patients with Crohn's disease suffer from folate deficiency, suggesting that regular screening should be performed. 
1516	Presented here is a system to standardize clinical studies of nutrient effects, using nutrient-specific physiological criteria. These guidelines are based mainly on analysis of the typical sigmoid curve of biological response to nutrients and are intended for design, interpretation, and pooling of studies of nutrient effects. Five rules have been articulated for individual studies of nutrients, and six for systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses.  
1517	Acute appendicitis, characterized as periumbilical pain, migrating to the right iliac fossa, is one of the most common acute surgical conditions. It is usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms. However, some patients may present atypically and are prone to be misdiagnosed. We report this first case of acute appendicitis who presented initially with complain of diarrhea accompanying hypokalemia. There have been no published data suggesting its existence in any parts of the world. 
1518	Electrochemotherapy (ECT) holds promise as a minimally invasive palliative tool for selected patients with peristomal tumors. We present the favorable short-term outcome of three patients (two with head and neck cancer, one with gastric cancer) successfully palliated by ECT. Treatment effectiveness and clinical benefit for patients with unresectable stoma recurrence need to be confirmed in future multicenter studies.  
1519	Analysis of a large prospectively followed cohort of patients with thrombocythemia focusing upon 307 of the 3643 who were receiving the combination of anagrelide and hydroxycarbamide with discussion of complications of major complications, but does not mention liver related severe adverse events.
1520	We studied the influence of weather on the etiology of healthcare-associated bloodstream infections in a hospital in Brazil during the years 2005-2010. Monthly average temperatures were positively associated with higher incidence of gram-negative bacilli as a whole, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacter species. The same groups presented seasonal behavior in stochastic models.

1582	The electronic cigarette is a subject of lively debate in the literature and the legislative. We will review the updates regarding progress on this issue by analyzing the device, the electronic cigarette composition, legislative issues and medical strategy. All will be analyzed in terms of the benefits, but also the immediate and remote consequences 
1583	The low bioavailability of most flavonoids limits their application as anti-carcinogenic agents in humans. A novel approach of treatment with a mixture of bioactive compounds that share molecular anti-carcinogenic targets may enhance the effect on these targets at low concentrations of individual compound, thereby overcoming the limitations of reduced bioavailability. We therefore investigated whether a combination of three natural products arctigenin (Arc), a novel anti-inflammatory lignan from the seeds of  
1584	Disseminated Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) may occur in immunosuppressed patients, most commonly causing visceral organ involvement and rarely presenting solely with cutaneous lesions.

1604	Patients with cardiomyopathy have a higher incidence of mood and anxiety disorders, resulting in greater probability for hospitalisation and increased risk for arrhythmia and death. We report a case of a 16-year-old boy with Danon disease, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, who later developed depression and significant weight loss. The patient was successfully treated for his anxiety and depression with mirtazapine without any adverse cardiac effects.  
1605	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are highly dynamic and often denature when extracted in detergents. Deriving thermostable mutants has been a successful strategy to stabilize GPCRs in detergents, but this process is experimentally tedious. We have developed a computational method to predict the position of the thermostabilizing mutations for a given GPCR sequence. We have validated the method against experimentally measured thermostability data for single mutants of the Î˛

Although the lesions are often asymptomatic, their appearance may be distressing to patients. FEP has been treated with topical tretinoin in one case report ( 1 ). Other reports have not mentioned treatment for this rare disorder ( 1-6 ). We present a case of FEP successfully treated with a fractionated carbon dioxide (CO2) laser.  
1612	"With great interest, we read the article ""A systematic review of matrix metalloproteinase 9 as a biomarker of survival in patients with osteosarcoma"" (by Li H et al.). This article suggests that high expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) is associated with a poor prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma [1]. The result is encouraging. Nevertheless, some flaws existed in this meta-analysis that we would like to point out.  "
1613	Eccrine poromas are rare, benign adnexal tumors that often occur as solitary papules. Rarely, eccrine poromas can present as multiple lesions, which is referred to as eccrine poromatosis. We report a case of eccrine poromatosis occuring on the palms and soles occuring after chemotherapy in a patient with a history of acute myeloid leukemia.  
1614	Congenital hemangiomas (CH) are benign vascular neoplasms that proliferate in utero and have completed development by birth. Two subtypes of CH are recognized: rapidly involuting congenital hemangiomas (RICH) and non-involuting congenital hemangiomas (NICH). Involution of the RICH subtype often begins in the first weeks of life. NICH does not involute, allowing the distinction between RICH and NICH. We report a case of an infant with RICH occurring on the scalp, examined at birth and followed for 26 weeks.  
1615	Central nervous system infection is a rare complication of endovascular procedures. We report a 21-year-old woman presented with headache, nausea, vomiting, and right-sided hemiparesis 4 months after endovascular embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformation. Investigations led to the diagnosis of multiple brain abscesses. This is the sixth case report of brain abscess following endovascular interventions.  
1616	An efficient synthetic approach has been adopted to construct a new dendron-based octa-guanidine appended molecular transporter with a lysosomal targeted peptide-doxorubicin conjugate. The transporter alone (G8-PPI-FL) is found to be non-toxic, showed higher cellular uptake compared to Arg-8-mer and exhibited excellent selectivity towards lysosomes in cathepsin B expressing HeLa cells, while the Dox-conjugate showed significant cytotoxicity to cancer cells without affecting the non-cancerous cells.  
1617	A 67-year-old male who presented to the eye casualty department with deterioration in his vision was diagnosed with retinal angiomatous proliferation. After initial deterioration with ranibizumab intravitreal injections, we have demonstrated successful treatment and stabilised vision with ranibizumab and a single intravitreal triamcinolone injection. Stringent follow-up and top-up ranibizumab injections have stabilised his vision and have shown foveal improvement on optical coherence tomography imaging.  
1618	Soft-tissue sarcomas are rare and often confused for more common and benign disorders during diagnosis. Chronic expanding hematomas are particularly difficult to distinguish from soft-tissue malignancy. We describe the case of a morbidly obese patient with a chronic expanding hematoma in the distal posterior thigh whose definitive treatment was delayed 6 months because of her pregnancy status and inability to lie prone for open biopsy.  
1619	We report in this work that the AÎ˛ peptide directly interacts with tubulin close to the vinblastine and GTP/GDP binding site, inhibits the tubulin polymerization rate, induces tubulin aggregation, causes cell shrinking, enhances Mad2, BubR1, p53, and p21 activation in MCF7 cells and induces the apoptotic death of A549, HeLa and MCF7 cells.  
1620	This prospective cohort study investigates whether simple guideline-based asthma management using a 'Step-Up' regimen with the Asthma Control Test score improves asthma control in patients with inadequately controlled asthma in primary care. Seventy out of ninety-three (75%) participants achieved a score of > 19 (good control), and the mean increase in Asthma Control Test score was 6.0 (95% confidence interval: 5.3-6.8), P < 0.001. The improvement was independent of baseline inhaled corticosteroid use. 
1621	We report here the draft genomes of two drug (fluoroquinolone)-resistant clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa obtained from the corneal scrapings of keratitis patients from India. The two annotated genomes are 6.31Â Mb and 6.41Â Mb in size. These genomes are expected to facilitate the identification and understanding of the genes associated with acquired multidrug resistance.  
1622	Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been the standard treatment modality in patients with intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Brivanib is an oral small molecular inhibitor of both vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor receptors. Herein, we reported that a 67-year-old patient with intermediate stage HCC achieved the complete remission after TACE combined with brivanib therapy. This finding potentially suggested the benefit of this combination therapy for HCC.  
1623	We report a case of safe and successful yttrium-90 resin microsphere radioembolization in a patient with a long history of multiple recurrent colon cancer hepatic metastases progressing after hepatic resections, hepatic arterial chemotherapy, and multiple regimens of systemic chemotherapy. One month prior to radioembolization, a biliary stent was placed above the level of the ampulla to relieve tumor-related biliary obstruction and normalize bilirubin levels.  
1624	Hyperhomocysteinemia is implicated in retinal neurovascular diseases including arterial occlusive disease, venous occlusive disease and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma. The mechanism for these diseases is not known. Here we used hyperhomocysteinemic mice lacking the gene encoding cystathionine-beta-synthase ( 
1625	To assess the efficacy of a novel formulation of the polyene antibiotic, amphotericin B (AMB), as therapy for cutaneous leishmaniasis in different mouse strains. (AMB), was formulated into water-soluble transport particles, termed nanodisks (ND). Balb/c and CH AMB-ND is efficacious in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis in both susceptible and resistant mouse strains. It may be inferred that AMB-ND may be useful for prophylactic and/or treatment of early stage  
1626	Among 122 patients with CML resistant or intolerant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors who were treated with omacetaxine in phase 2 trials, final follow up showed overall survival of 40 months in chronic phase and 14 months in accelerated phase cases; hematologic adverse events occurred in 79% and 73% of patients and led to early discontinuation in 10% and 5%; 69 patients [56%] had at least one serious adverse event, but none were liver related.
1627	New targets have been set for value-based payment: 85% of Medicare fee-for-service payments should be tied to quality or value by 2016, and 30% of Medicare payments should be tied to quality or value through alternative payment models by 2016 (50% by 2018).
1628	President Obama has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine, with a near-term focus on cancers and a longer-term aim to generate knowledge applicable to the whole range of health and disease.
1629	Interactive Perspective: Drug Development and FDA Approval, 1938-2013 (June 26, 2014;370:e39). The order of authors was incorrect; Dr. Darrow should have been listed first, and Dr. Kesselheim second. The article is correct at NEJM.org.
1630	Among 261 patients with progressive and refractory thyroid cancer treated with lenvatinib [24 mg daily] or placebo, median progression free survival was improved by lenvatinib [18.3 vs 3.6 months], although side effects were frequent and sometimes severe; liver failure was report in 0.4% of recipients.
1631	Transfluthrin is being used as fast acting insecticide and liquid mosquito repellent. This is a case report of poisoning with transfluthrin (90 ml liquid containing 792 mg of transfluthrin) by a 25-year-old female. Tonic-clonic convulsions were not controlled with conventional drugs. In intensive care unit, patient was managed with muscle paralysis by neuromuscular blocking drug vecuronium and elective mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h under care of the anaesthesiologist with uneventful recovery.  
1632	Acute subdural hematomas (ASDHs) are rarely reported in the literature. In general, it is due to head trauma, but if the traumatic event is very mild, it is inadequate to explain the ASDH occurrence. Risk factors for the development of spontaneous ASDH include hypertension, vascular abnormalities and deficit of coagulation. We present two cases of ASDH in patients with the coagulation deficit and review of the literature to understand the coagulation factors role and platelet role in the management of ASDHs.  
1633	Gastrointestinal mucormycosis is an uncommon, invasive, opportunistic fungal infection with a high mortality rate, seen more commonly in immunocompromised patients. This lethal infection has a wide range of presentations, from colonization of peptic ulcers to infiltrative disease and eventually vascular invasion. Here we present a case of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in an immunocompromised patient, which was proved to be secondary to gastric involvement by mucormycosis.  
1634	Two children with different digestive diseases were admitted to the gastroenterology department of a children's hospital in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China, in May 2010. They manifested successively acute lower respiratory tract infection symptoms during their stay in the hospital. The epidemiologic and experimental evidence supports that one child acquired nosocomial coinfection with measles virus and human metapneumovirus from another child while they shared the same ward.  
1635	The pathogenesis of mastocytosis is not well defined and thus treatment remains challenging and remains on a palliative basis. We present two cases (a 48-year-old woman and a 57-year-old man) with indolent systemic mastocytosis in whom omalizumab (anti-IgE) reduced gastrointestinal and cutaneous symptoms significantly. This observation provides additional insight into the effects of omalizumab on systemic mastocytosis.  
1636	Scurvy was first described by Hippocrates (460-370 BC) as a condition characterised by poor dental health, bruising, bleeding and fragile skin. Despite the widespread availability of foods rich in vitamin C in Australia, scurvy continues to afflict certain high-risk subgroups of the population. Cutaneous signs may be the only manifestation of the disease, as in the case presented below, and therefore scurvy continues to be relevant to dermatologists.  
1637	Pregnant women are advised to stop drinking alcohol, but there is very little evidence-based guidance on the management of alcohol withdrawal. We describe a case of alcohol withdrawal during pregnancy and summarize available information on treatment.  
1638	Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) comprises a heterogeneous group of primary antibody deficiencies which lead to a range of complications, including infectious, neoplastic and inflammatory disorders. This report describes monozygotic twin brothers with CVID who developed cryptogenic liver disease and subsequently hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). This is the second report of the association of HPS and CVID. Its occurrence in two identical twins implicates a genetic basis.  
1639	"Analysis of claims of bosentan and for laboratory services in a large research database identified 523 patients, but high rates of non-adherence to recommendations for regular ALT and AST monitoring, 29% having less than 50% on-therapy testing."
1640	Given the 96 incidents of firearm violence on school campuses since Sandy Hook and the ongoing toll on lives and health, the lack of relevant data and a research pipeline in this area should be anathema to all physicians.

1971	Aberrant activity of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is involved in a wide range of human cancer progression. The WD40 repeat-containing protein EED is a core component of PRC2 and enhances PRC2 activity through interaction with H3K27me3. In this study, we report the discovery of a class of pyrimidone compounds, represented by BR-001, as potent allosteric inhibitors of PRC2. X-ray co-crystallography showed that BR-001 directly binds EED in the H3K27me3-binding pocket. BR-001 displayed antitumor potency  
1972	Authors have only now noticed that in the Figure 3a, the immunohistochemical analysis of IL-4RÎ± on paraffin-embedded sections from breast is incorrect: IL-4 from breast was duplicated and used for the IL-4RÎ± staining. The correct Figure 3a has been included in the amendment to this paper.An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.

1990	We thank Dr. C. Adlhoch and Dr. SA Baylis for their comments on our study describing the impact of rat hepatitis E virus (Orthohepevirus C genotype 1 or HEV-C1) on human health in Hong Kong. We concur with them that HEV-C1 infection is currently a blind spot in hepatitis E diagnostic testing. As they point out, routinely used molecular assays for HEV diagnostics or blood donor screening would not be able to detect HEV-C1.
1991	La Mura et al(1) described a new prognostic algorithm to improve risk-stratification after variceal bleeding. Although this new algorithms looks appealing, it is unlikely to translate into any meaningful benefit in survival or reduced cost.
1992	We thank Primignani etal for taking interest in our article. We agree with their comments that the cut-offs of conventional tests and thromboelastography used in our study for transfusion of blood products is arbitrary. There are also no studies assessing whether blood products are actually needed in patients with cirrhosis in various clinical settings and different degrees of coagulopathy.
1993	We read with interest the article by Kumar et al(1) and wish to make comments. A TEG-guided transfusion policy [with arbitrary thresholds of r>10min for fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and maximal amplitude (MA) <55mm for platelets transfusion] led to sparing blood products compared to standard of care (SOC) in patients with advanced cirrhosis, non-variceal bleeding and coagulopathy, defined by an international normalized ratio (INR) >1.8 and/or platelet count <50x10(9) /L.
1994	We thank Arora et al. for their interest in our study. They comment on the limitations of our study which proposes the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and associated sphingolipid cargo as a novel biomarker for alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and reiterate our own conclusion for the need of validation of our findings in a larger cohort.
1995	We have read with interest the recent article of Du et al,((1)) in which they construct a bile duct-on-a-chip to study morphology, polarity, and barrier functions of monolayer cholangiocytes. However, we have some questions on the use of biliatresone in the bile duct-on-a-chip device separately from the apical or basal surface to conclude that its damage was worse with basal as opposed to apical administration.
1996	We read with interest the article by Banini et al.(1) They have succinctly described the pathophysiology and management of hepatic hydrothorax. We would like to share a few thoughts on the management of hepatic hydrothorax.
1997	"Several therapeutic options have been developed to improve our ability to cure chronic HBV infection(1). In this issue of Hepatology, Fergusson et al describe the development of HBV-specific ""Immune mobilizing monoclonal T cell receptors Against Virus"" (ImmTAV), a novel and elegant immune therapeutic strategy designed to substitute and potentially restore HBV-specific CD8T cells in chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) patients."
1998	We read with great interest the study by Ishikawa et al. The authors found that induction of the mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen, blastocyst H2 (H2-Bl) expression by growth hormone is critical for suppressing innate immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells/NK T cells (NKTs) and macrophage-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis, which favors C57BL/6 mice liver regeneration and survival after partial hepatectomy.
1999	We appreciate Gao et al. for their interest in our recent manuscript on the association between elevated liver biochemistries and severe COVID-19 infection. We would like to address their comments to further elucidate the interpretation of our findings.
2000	Adolescent girls with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) fit in at least two of the target populations wherein Wegermann et al propose to tackle NAFLD [1]. Diagnostic features of adolescent PCOS are androgen excess (clinical and biochemical) and menstrual irregularity, but ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver is emerging as a key pathogenic mechanism, apparently driven by a mismatch between (reduced) prenatal weight gain and (augmented) postnatal weight gain [2].
